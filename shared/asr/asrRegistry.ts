/**
 * The ASR provider seam: the contract every adapter satisfies, and the address book that hands
 * one out by id.
 *
 * WHY THE CONTRACT AND THE REGISTRY SHARE A FILE. ADR-004 §L1 sketches the contract in its own
 * `shared/asr/asrContract.ts`. That module would be a third file both compiler configurations
 * compile, and it is not part of this task's declared write surface, so the types live here next
 * to the table that hands providers out. Splitting them later is a pure move with no behaviour in
 * it; the ordering that matters is the one this file keeps, which is that a provider cannot be
 * registered without satisfying the contract — the `AsrAdapter` annotation on the table below is
 * what enforces it.
 *
 * TWO COMPILER CONFIGURATIONS COMPILE THIS FILE, and that is a machine property rather than a
 * style choice: the root configuration compiles it with `lib: ES2020 + DOM` and
 * `types: ["vite/client"]`, `server/tsconfig.json` compiles it with `lib: ES2022`, NodeNext and
 * `types: ["node"]`. So it may use neither Node built-ins nor ES2021+ library features, and every
 * environment dependency (fetch, credentials, base URL, model) is injected at the call site
 * rather than read from the environment here. `npm run typecheck` compiling this one file under
 * both configurations is the reading that says so.
 *
 * UNKNOWN IDS ARE FAIL-CLOSED. The id is stored in user-level configuration, so a typo or a
 * version skew makes an unregistered id a reachable state. `resolve` throws rather than falling
 * back to a default provider: a silent fallback's worst case is a user who believes they are
 * transcribing with the service they chose while the previous one answers. `tryResolve` is the
 * non-throwing form for callers that want to report that state instead of catching it.
