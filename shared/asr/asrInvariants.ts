/**
 * The transcription seam's contract board: the five invariant groups of ADR-004 §L3(b), written
 * ONCE and driven by both runners.
 *
 * `src/shared/asr/tests/asrContractInvariants.test.ts` drives it as suite readings and
 * `scripts/asr-contract-invariants-check.mjs` drives it as an operator command. Neither holds an
 * invariant of its own: a probe written in the checker and a probe written in the suite would be
 * two implementations of one contract, and a green checker could disagree with a red suite about
 * what "the invariants hold" means.
 *
 * THE BOARD IS PARAMETERISED BY THE REGISTRY, not by a provider list written here. Every group
 * runs against every adapter the caller hands it, so a provider added to `asrRegistry.ts`
 * tomorrow is measured by this file the day it is registered.
 *
 * IT IS ALSO PARAMETERISED BY THE WIRE — and that is a correction rather than a feature. A
 * registered adapter is only half a subject: the readings below are about a request, and a request
 * only exists in some shape. The first version of this board had the multimodal shape written
 * through it — the generation endpoint, a JSON body, base64 audio, a generation envelope — so
 * registering the SHIPPED recogniser (a multipart `/audio/transcriptions` adapter) turned every
 * group red with readings that said the new adapter was broken when the board was. That is the
 * same fault the seam exists to prevent, one level up: expectations held once, for a shape, in a
 * place that then measures a different one. The shape an adapter speaks is therefore DECLARED
 * (`AsrAdapter.wire`) and this file derives its expectations from that declaration, which makes the
 * declaration itself a second thing under test: an adapter that declares one wire and sends another
 * disagrees with the golden body its own declaration implies.
 *
 * A WIRE IS ALSO WHERE THE CREDENTIAL'S HEADER NAME COMES FROM — `authorization` on the multipart
 * shape, `x-goog-api-key` on the generation one — so the credential readings ask each wire's own
 * header rather than one name chosen here. A board that read `authorization` on both would report
 * every generation-shape request as unauthenticated and red an adapter that was authenticating
 * correctly, which is the same fault one level down: the board's own vocabulary deciding what
 * counts as a credential.
 *
 * AN EMPTY BOARD IS NOT A GREEN BOARD. A registry that resolved to zero providers, or a group
 * that produced zero readings, is `empty` — never `pass`. An exit code 0 from a glob that matched
 * nothing is a shape this repository has already paid for, so `readings.length === 0` is scored
 * as loudly as a disagreement is.
 *
 * ENVIRONMENT NEUTRALITY is the same machine property `./asrRegistry.ts` documents: this file is
 * compiled by the root configuration (`lib: ES2020 + DOM`, `types: ["vite/client"]`) AND by
 * `server/tsconfig.json` (`lib: ES2022`, NodeNext, `types: ["node"]`). So it uses no Node built-in
 * and no ES2021+ library feature, and every environment dependency travels in as a parameter.
 * Relative specifiers end in `.js` because NodeNext demands it.

 * WHY THE THIRD GROUP IS ONE CODE AND NOT THREE. A 5xx, a timeout and a refused connection are one
 * member of `AsrErrorCode` by construction: from this side of the seam the caller's remedy is the
 * same for all of them, and the browser's direct path and the server's proxy path have to answer one

 * SHAPE reaching the adapter — a status, an abort, a rejection, a body that is not JSON — and it is
 * the shape, not the code, that a regression would break.
 *
 * Every row here reaches the transport, so every row spends exactly one request: the two guards
 * that refuse BEFORE the transport are the size and mime groups' subject, not this one's.
