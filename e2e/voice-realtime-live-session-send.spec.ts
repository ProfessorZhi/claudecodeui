/**
 * GOAL-033 / AC-316 — the browser's Live Voice criterion, on a real browser
 * against a real server.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. AC-312 proved the chain microphone → audio frames → a
 * model tool call → an editable on-screen intent → an explicit send →
 * `session_send` → a transcript row. AC-316 removes the draft-and-confirm step
 * and makes voice a MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE mode with the text composer, rendered as a
 * fixed compact bar that captures continuously until Mute or End. This file drives
 * that new shape and reads each claim as a DOM or protocol fact:
 *
 *   · entering Live Voice swaps `ChatComposer` out and `VoiceRealtimeBar` in —
 *     never both at once, on 1280px and on 375px;
 *   · the old draft control plane (`voice-realtime-start` / visible
 *     `voice-realtime-upload` / `voice-realtime-intent` / `voice-realtime-send` /
 *     `voice-realtime-cancel`) is gone, not moved;
 *   · the bar's height does not change phase to phase (the "never grows, never
 *     goes full-screen" requirement);
 *   · capture is continuous: Mute withholds frames WITHOUT closing the connection,
 *     and Unmute resumes on the same connection;
 *   · a model-proposed `session_send` executes immediately (no browser round-trip)
 *     and its turn lands through the ordinary transcript rendering.
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS NOT. The microphone is a stand-in because no CI machine
 * has one: an init script replaces `AudioContext`, `AudioWorkletNode` and
 * `getUserMedia` with an inert graph this file pushes PCM into
 * (`__voiceFake.speak(0.6)`), exactly the interface the real worklet forwards. The
 * Realtime upstream (DashScope) is a stand-in too: the server dials
 * `VOICE_REALTIME_ENDPOINT`, which `playwright.config.ts` points at a port this
 * file's own WS server owns. Everything else — the browser hook, the
 * `/voice-realtime` proxy, the bridge, the real `session_send` and the transcript
 * write — is the shipping code.
 *
 * WHY BOTH LEGS SHARE ONE SESSION. The criterion's own words are "the currently
 * open session": the legs are two gestures in front of the same chat pane, and
 * the mobile leg proves the same binding at 375px rather than a different one.
 * Each leg opens its own `/voice-realtime` socket, so each reaches the fake
 * upstream on a fresh connection and gets its own proposal.

 * from the behaviour it is compared against: whatever default that function ships — segmented
 * (the P4 rollout decision) or continuous (the 2026-10-13 experience-first ruling, GOAL-044) —
 * this run reads it rather than a copy of it. A hand-written `!== 'continuous'` is exactly the
 * copy that went stale when the default flipped: it answered "segmented" for an unset variable
 * while the server had started answering "continuous", so the branch below asserted `commit`-based
 * framing against a proxy that had stopped committing.
 *
 * WHY THE SPEC PROCESS'S OWN ENVIRONMENT IS THE SERVER'S. `VOICE_REALTIME_MODE` is a DEPLOYMENT
 * setting, read once at server start-up. `playwright.config.ts` assembles that server's environment
 * by spreading this runner's and overriding the key only for the continuous-only selections
 * (`voiceContinuousOnlySelection` — the experience baseline and the silence-tail criterion, each
 * measured as its run's ONLY spec). This criterion selects two specs, so no override applies and
 * the key the resolver sees here is the key the server was started with.
 *
 * The same answer decides which framing the upstream should have seen, so the AC-319 assertion
 * below is a real reading of the run's own configuration rather than a re-statement of it.

        // voice-activity detector measures its noise floor as the sliding 15th percentile of
        // the frames it has just seen, so a constant-amplitude burst BECOMES that floor and
        // never clears the speech factor above it — a flat `samples.fill(0.3)` is silence to
        // the detector, so the segmented client released no segment and this spec's upstream
        // frame counts sat at zero under the default configuration. One burst is therefore
        // built like a spoken sentence: a quiet lead-in for the detector's half-second
        // bootstrap to calibrate against, a syllable-shaped run (a 3 Hz envelope over a
        // 180 Hz carrier) that reads as speech, and a trailing pause longer than the relay's
        // own 2.0 s commit gap. The pause is what makes the sentence COMMIT and reach the
        // upstream while the spec is still listening, rather than waiting inside the
        // segmenter for Mute or End to flush it. A committed sentence is not a delivered turn
        // yet, though: the proxy holds its relay until a LATER sentence commits, which is why
