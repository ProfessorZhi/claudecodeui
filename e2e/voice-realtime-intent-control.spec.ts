/**
 * gap-live-voice-intent-control-browser-e2e — the DoD walkthrough for AC-345 (GOAL-041, SPEC
 * `docs/proposals/voice-realtime-persistent-control-SPEC.md`): intent control read in a REAL browser
 * against a REAL app server, driven by the shared scripted Realtime upstream.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. The server criteria (`voice-realtime-interrupt.test.ts`,
 * `…-interrupt-fence.test.ts`, `…-interrupt-revision-order.test.ts`) drive the proxy in-process, and
 * the unit criteria drive the hook against a stubbed socket. Neither can read the two things this
 * task is about: that the numbers the PERSON is shown are the ones the session actually holds, and
 * that the words a person spoke reach the CLI in the order they were spoken when the person both
 * types and talks. Those are comparisons between two parties that could have disagreed, so they are
 * read here, in a browser, against a real CLI queue.
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS NOT. Real: the browser, the app server, the `/voice-realtime` proxy, the
 * bridge, the live executor, the real `session_send`/`session_interrupt` reaching the real MCP
 * control plane, the chat websocket, the provider runtime and the host driver's own command queue.
 * Not real: the microphone (no CI machine has one — an init script installs a Web Audio graph whose
 * worklet the spec pulses with ONE captured frame, because `listening` only becomes true after the
 * first captured frame, and the fake graph would otherwise never deliver one; every utterance below
 * still reaches the proxy as the endpoint's own final transcript, exactly as it does in
 * `voice-realtime-scripted-scenarios.spec.ts`) and the
 * DashScope endpoint itself (the app dials the port `playwright.config.ts` points it at, on which
 * this file binds its own `ws` server).
 *
 * WHY THE UTTERANCES ARE THE ENDPOINT'S TRANSCRIPTS AND NOT A PACED AUDIO FILE. The landed task
 * `gap-voice-realtime-paced-audio-source` delivered `pacedFileAudioSource` with NO browser seam: the
 * factory is selected only by `useVoiceRealtimeSession.startWithFile` when its caller passes
 * `options`, and the only UI caller — the hidden upload input in `VoiceRealtimeBar.tsx` — passes
 * none; a native file input cannot carry a JS `schedule` function, so no `setInputFiles` can reach
 * it. Wiring one would mean changing the production upload path's shape, and this task's scope is a
 * criterion over the intent-control contract, not a new audio seam. A final transcription IS the
 * same reading either way — the proxy counts `utteranceSeq`, fires the fence and passes the words to
 * the page on this event whether the audio came from a file or from the wire — so the utterances are
 * driven here the way the sibling spec drives them, and `## Notes` records the deviation.
 *
 * CLOUD API IS FORBIDDEN BY CONSTRUCTION (AC3). `playwright.config.ts` blanks `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` on
 * this selection's server and runs it from a root with no `.env`, so the handshake carries no
 * credential; the case below reads the ABSENCE of `authorization` on the upgrade, the page's
 * non-loopback traffic (exactly its two pinned Google-Fonts stylesheets) and the upstream's own dial
 * count, so "zero cloud calls" is an observation rather than a claim.
 *
 * ⛔ fan-in's suite (`scripts/test.sh`) does not run Playwright. This file self-certifies the DoD, and
 * the readings in its `console.log` lines are copied into the task's `## Notes`.
 *
 * Run:
 *   QUAY_LIVE_VOICE_SHOT_DIR=<dir outside the checkout> \
 *     bash scripts/with-memory-cap.sh npx playwright test e2e/voice-realtime-intent-control.spec.ts

/**
 * How long the walk waits between two `unattended-turn` steps — the mechanism that makes a
 * `session_send` a QUEUED delivery, and not pacing.
 *
 * The host driver decides turn-versus-push by reading whether the session already holds a turn at the
 * instant the command arrives (`debug-agent.host-driver.ts`: `busy = turnByAppSession.has(...)`, read
 * BEFORE the runner is entered, and the busy option is stamped only when it is true). A session that
 * is already mid-turn has the command PUSHED — the host mints it an id and the CLI holds it behind
 * the run — while an IDLE session makes the very same command OPEN a turn and answer `queued: false`
 * with no id at all. A walk that opens ONE turn and then parks therefore measures its first send as a
 * push and every later one as a turn; that is what a sibling walk recorded, and what this file's own
 * first red was (both sends settled `queued: false`, so the order readings below had no command id to
 * join on).
 *
 * So the walk opens a turn every {@link TURN_CADENCE_MS} for its whole length instead of once, and
 * every send below lands on a session that is holding one. The cadence is deliberately shorter than
 * the relay's own 2.5 s coalescing window: a send may be answered while the next turn is opening, and
 * all the ordering needs is that a turn EXISTS at the instant the command arrives.
 *
 * IT IS ALSO THE WAIT EVERY SEND IS PACED ON. A delivery's own carrier supersedes the turn the walk is
 * drawing, so the send after it waits for the NEXT turn to be on disk before it goes (see
 * `waitForTurnAfter`) — which means the cadence is waited out once per send, in every case below, and
 * a whole-file run pays it a dozen times. One second is as short as the guarantee allows (the window it
 * must stay under is 2.5 s) and it halves that bill; {@link TURN_COUNT} is raised to match, so the walk

/**
 * The steps that make the session read "BUSY" to the relay (AC7) — a steady cadence of

 *
 * THE ONE SIGNAL THE COMPOSITION READS FOR A DEBUG SESSION. The relay's hold — the ONE merged pending
 * message the ruling put above the bar — is gated on the host's `busy` reading (`hostRunActivity` →
 * `composeHostRunActivityReading`, `server/index.ts`). For a Claude-speaking resident session that
 * reading comes from the driver's own `rounds`; a debug-agent session has no such driver, so the
 * composition falls back to the activity store's TURN PHASE, and the walk must produce the row that
 * phase is reduced from. An `unattended-turn` writes only a USER row, which the phase reducer does not
 * read — so the phase stayed `idle` and the relay never held anything (the reading this task exists to
 * close). A `thinking-tokens` step writes the one row a `system/thinking_tokens` frame becomes
 * (`claude-turn-phase.service.ts`'s `enterPhase(sessionId, 'thinking')`).
 *
 * WHY A CADENCE AND NOT ONE STEP. The phase is not held by one row: the walk's own unattended runs
 * settle and the reduction returns the turn to `idle`, and the hold poll (`busyPollMs`, 250 ms)
 * releases the moment it reads `idle`. So the signal is re-asserted faster than the poll can observe a
 * gap — {@link BUSY_SIGNAL_INTERVAL_MS} is well under that poll — which is what keeps the hold engaged
 * for the whole case rather than for the second after the first row. The rows cost nothing a reading
 * looks at: they carry no message text, only the phase signal.
 *
 * SCOPED BY THE WALK, deliberately: the phase is keyed per session and is fixed by the rows THIS
 * scenario writes, so no sibling spec's session (which writes no such row) can be made busy by it.
 * That is why the busy reading is driven from the fixture rather than by teaching the debug host
 * driver a `runInFlight` — the latter would flip `busy` for every debug walk in the suite, not only
 * the one that means to measure the hold.

 * PUSHED into the CLI's queue; a cadence of phase rows, so the RELAY's reading stays busy — the relay
 * answers `hostRunActivity` for a debug-agent session from the activity store's turn phase, because
 * the debug host driver has no `runInFlight` (a Claude driver's `rounds` is the reading it lacks); and

 * THE PHASE CADENCE IS NOT PACING. The phase is reduced from the rows this walk writes and carries no

 *
 * A SINGLE TURN, NOT A CADENCE OF THEM. {@link heldScenario} opens a turn per second because its cases
 * need a turn to EXIST whenever a send lands. Here the turn must stay open across everything, so the

   *
   * ⛔ THE DELIVERY READINGS WERE RE-ANCHORED TO THE POST-RULING MODEL (2026-10-14 human ruling; AC6).
   * The pre-ruling file asserted that each spoken sentence became a command of its OWN in the CLI's
   * queue (`hostQueued === 2`, a `waitForQueued` per sentence, `order.length === 4`). Under the ruling
   * that is the opposite of what a BUSY session does: the relay keeps every sentence out of the CLI's
   * queue (零逐句投递), draws ONE merged pending card, and the interrupt folds the held words + the
   * correction + the note into ONE enqueue-then-abort. So the readings below are the post-ruling ones:
   * zero per-sentence deliveries while busy, one merged card, one folded command.
   *
   * THE WALK IS BUSY FOR ITS WHOLE LENGTH (see {@link BUSY_SIGNAL_STEP}): the turn-phase signal it
   * opens with makes the host report a run in flight, so the hold engages on the first word and the
   * sentences never reach the CLI until the interrupt folds them in. Cases 2–7 keep the queue-model
   * walk (see {@link heldScenario}) because their readings are about the queue itself.
   *
   * AC3 IS READ HERE TOO: the upstream's dial really happened, it carried NO credential, and nothing
   * the page touched left the loopback.

   * a delivery's heard sentences measured against its own words by adjacent-character-pair overlap
   * and, where "uncovered", spliced in verbatim in front (the pair-overlap span guard).
   * The guard and its module are deleted by the ruling of 2026-10-16 (task
   * `gap-live-voice-one-text-per-segment-prefer-response`): 每个语音片段只应有一次文本进入 CLI；优先用
   * response；仅在确认一段音频没有 response 时才 fallback 到 transcript. The live round of that day
   * (journal `3d2d3b2c`, 13:20) is why: the endpoint misheard "LiveWire" as "来望也", the model
   * repaired it off the audio IN THE SAME RESPONSE, and the measure scored the pair 0.462 — a rewrite
   * read as a drop, the mishearing delivered in front of the words that corrected it. An interrupt
   * whose call carries a correction IS a response for its span, so it delivers the correction alone;
   * what the span left unclaimed — here the phrase — is answered for exactly where AC-345's own
   * counter-argument said it would be: not "上了屏、投递无门", but handed back to the input box.
   *
   * THE DISCRIMINATION IS KEPT, AND IT IS THE REVERSE OF THE RE-ANCHORED ONE: restore the guard and
   * the queue carries the phrase, so the assertion below goes red.

  /**
   * Case 5 — an interrupt whose correction cannot be CONFIRMED as enqueued is answered honestly, and
   * the page is not told a stop happened.
   *
   * THE FAULT IS A MISSING CONFIRMATION, and it is the one the code actually reaches. G1 enqueues the
   * correction before it aborts, and it aborts ONLY on that enqueue being confirmed
   * (`queuedMessageUuid !== null || queued === true`). A confirmation the session does not give is
   * therefore the relay's own reading of "the correction never reached it" — and a correction that
   * never reached the session must not stop the run it was meant to correct. The receipt says so
   * (`stopped:false`, `reason:'revision-not-enqueued'`), the stop path is never entered, and — the
   * reading a person gets — NOTHING on the wire or on screen claims a stop.
   *
   * WHY THE CONFIRMATION IS THE READING AND THE QUEUE IS NOT. The gateway answers a delivery out of the
   * debug agent's chat-run registry while the sentence itself is queued by the agent's own host driver,
   * and the two disagree in exactly this walk: a `busy` dispatch never clears the driver's
   * `turnByAppSession`, while the push's carrier run DOES complete in the chat registry — so the next
   * dispatch finds a free slot, answers `{queued:false, queuedMessageUuid:null}`, and the driver pushes
   * the command anyway. The relay reads only the confirmation, so it withholds the stop. Asking the
   * CLI's queue whether the correction is there would therefore read this drift rather than the relay,
   * which is why what this case pins about the queue is that the refusal took NOTHING AWAY from it: a
   * receipt is honest about what its author can see, and what the relay can see is the confirmation.
   *
   * THE WALK OPENS ONE TURN AND THEN STOPS, which is what makes the fault deterministic rather than
   * raced: the opening sentence is a push (a turn is in flight in front of it, and a push's carrier
   * frees the slot as it is accepted), and no further turn is ever opened, so the correction's own
   * enquiry finds the idle session this case is about however long the run took to get there.
   *
   * AND THAT IS WHY NOTHING HERE WAITS FOR A RUN ON SCREEN. The slot the push freed is the same thing
   * that ends the run the page was drawing — the push's carrier supersedes it and resolves — so an
   * idle session and a visible `running-turn-stop` are mutually exclusive states in this walk, and the
   * fault under test IS the idle one. Waiting for the run here would be waiting for a state the fault
   * forbids; the readings below are the ones the fault's own shape leaves readable, and the sentence
   * that opened the case is the evidence that a run really was in flight in front of it.
