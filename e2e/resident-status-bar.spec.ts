/**
 * The resident dock's process panel, its sidebar mark and the panel's two verbs — read off a real
 * browser against a real server, driven by the debug agent's own scenario clock.
 *
 * What this file is *for*. The feature is a surface that describes a process the page does not own:
 * four states, an address, and one row style for a turn nobody typed. Every one of those is a
 * comparison — the sidebar mark against the listing, the address the panel prints against the one
 * the listing publishes, the label against the locale file, the divider against the trigger that
 * produced it — and a comparison is only evidence when both sides were read from somewhere that
 * could have disagreed. So nothing here is asserted against a value this file also wrote: the states
 * come from `GET /api/session-hosts`, the copy comes from the platform clipboard, the labels come
 * from the shipped locale JSON, and the rows come from the transcript the server wrote.
 *
 * Why the debug agent. The alternative is a real `claude` process, and a criterion that needs one is
 * a criterion that cannot run where the binary is absent. `POST /api/debug-agent/clock` walks a
 * scenario instead: the same product chain (provider runtime → host manager → run registry → the
 * normalizer the transcript is read through) with the child process replaced by a scripted clock, so
 * a turn can be opened, held and ended at a moment this file chooses. The gate that mounts that face
 * is opened by `playwright.config.ts` for exactly this file's selection, so no other run's server
 * grows a fixture-writing endpoint.
 *
 * Why the clock is not awaited where it is fired. `POST /clock` blocks for the whole walk — it awaits
 * each step's absolute offset from the run's start. Every reading below therefore happens *while* the
 * walk is in flight, which is the only place the states exist at all: after the response returns, the
 * process has already been walked back to rest. The response is awaited at the end, for the two facts
 * only it carries (which run opened the unattended turn, and whether the seam that opens runs is
 * wired).
 *
 * Two arms, one session each, because the panel's Close and the walk's `exit` cannot both be last:
 * arm A carries the identity, the panel, the copy and the close; arm B carries the walk, the abort
 * and the transcript rows. Splitting them is not a convenience — an arm that both closed a host and
 * expected it to exit would be reading the second half of its own first half.

//
// This spec's startup path, bounded. Measured: a page-period Vite dependency pre-bundle (a cold re-optimize this
// run's own `vite-cache/deps` had to build after `seedViteCache()` silently degraded) holds every in-flight module
// request until it commits and then pushes `full-reload`, which replaces the document whole. The module graph never
// finished executing — `ThemeContext.tsx`, the module barrels, `i18n/config.ts` and the rest were still in flight
// (response status -1) when the trace was cut, no `/api/*` was ever requested, React never mounted and the fixture
// project row never appeared. The only wait on that row was `revealSession`'s unbounded
// `waitFor({ state: 'visible', timeout: 30_000 })`: the run died at 30s with `TimeoutError: locator.waitFor:
// Timeout 30000ms exceeded`, not one of the four cases having run.
//
// The trigger (this run's own dependency optimization) is decided by the cache, not by this file. What is inside it
// is the *response*: the same interruption must cost a bounded replay, not an unbounded wait. Two levers, both
// already established in this repo's sibling specs — a bounded client warm-up and a bounded navigation probe, taken
// from `e2e/resident-running-view.spec.ts` and the `session-filter` / `transcript-follow` pair. Neither is invented
// here.
//
// What the guard may **not** do is decide anything for the four cases. It replays a navigation and it fails loudly
// when it cannot land; it never treats "not landed" as "good enough". Written the other way — probe times out,
// carry on — the four cases would each wait out their own budget on a blank document and the run would still cross
// the gate's 60s, which is what the bounded-failure reading in this task's AC measures.

 * out from under a navigation must end the run here, with a cause, rather than let the case below time out on a
 * page that never mounted.
 *
 * One pass is: navigate, then probe the landing with a short budget. A landing that does not arrive has the
 * navigation replayed — a fresh document, which is exactly what recovers from in-flight module requests that were
 * interrupted once — and the probe repeated, until the deadline. When the deadline is spent the guard throws with
 * the page's own text and this run's failed-request list, never silently continuing: a probe that cannot land must
 * end the run here, with a cause, rather than let four cases time out one after another on a document with nothing
 * in it.
 *
 * The navigation itself is bounded too, and a navigation that times out is treated as a landing that did not
 * arrive rather than as an error of its own — a document that never finishes loading and a document that loads
 * without ever mounting are the same failure from here, and both end at the same named error.
