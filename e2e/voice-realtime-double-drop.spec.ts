/**
 * The double-drop browser acceptance (GOAL-043 / AC-368).
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS. The 2026-10-12 Live Voice journal (`~/.cloudcli/voice-realtime-log/
 * e22ac831-30c6-4600-8bcf-b5c3cc7e3a8c.jsonl`) records a segmented session whose socket died three
 * times: the commit of one segment was written and never answered, the reconnect replayed it and lost
 * the replay 1.15 s later, the second reconnect replayed it once more, and only then did the bridge
 * stop. Everything downstream of that — which segment the page is told is un-delivered, whether the
 * sentences spoken afterwards are still attributed to their own segment and kept in spoken order, and
 * whether a segment is ever delivered twice — is what this spec reads off a REAL browser.
 *
 * TWO VARIANTS, ONE SCRIPTED UPSTREAM.
 *
 *   · 双断线 (the double drop) — the branch whose shape is the journal's. `DOUBLE_DROP_PLAN` is
 *     AC-365's dial-by-dial fault plan, extended by ONE dial: see the constant for why the third
 *     dial's ordinary entry is not enough to reach the reading this criterion's headline names
 *     (`DEFAULT_MAX_SEGMENT_REPLAYS = 2` spends the budget on the THIRD replay, not the second).
 *   · V-fatal (the permanent disconnect) — the branch where the endpoint stops answering and the
 *     bridge settles `closed` under a LIVE page socket. The words spoken after it must be marked
 *     not sent, and the bar must say the connection is gone.
 *
 * F6 — THE PLAN IS READ, THE DROPS ARE DRIVEN. `e2e/voiceRealtimeScriptedUpstream.ts`'s `armFaults`
 * is read-only by construction: the e2e upstream never fires a planned drop (its own `drop()` /
 * `refuseDials()` are the only things that end a connection), because a browser spec's timeline is
 * the browser's. So this spec arms the SAME `ScriptedFaultPlan` an in-process criterion arms, reads
 * each dial's entry back through `dialFaults()`, and drives the death the entry describes — the
 * `dropBeforeCommit` ordinal decides WHEN to drop, and `dropAfterCommitMs.ms` is the literal wait.
 * The two sides are written against one dial-by-dial script rather than two that can drift apart.
 *
 * WHAT IS REAL. The browser, the app server, `/voice-realtime`, the bridge, the transport, the
 * debug-agent provider standing in for Claude, and a real TCP dial to the spec's own loopback
 * listener. Not real: the microphone (the shaped-PCM fake the sibling voice specs use) and the
 * endpoint (the scripted upstream on `QUAY_E2E_VOICE_REALTIME_PORT`; `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` is blanked
 * by the config AND the server runs from a root with no `.env`, so the blank survives
 * `server/load-env.ts`'s backfill). Account: the shared `voice-realtime-e2e` fixture account — the
 * server is single-seat, and a private account would 403 every sibling voice spec.
 *
 * WHERE AC-367'S VERDICTS ARE READ NOW (operator's ruling, 2026-10-14, task
 * `gap-voice-ui-strip-to-caption-and-connection-state`). AC-367 gave the page three graded verdicts
 * and drew each as a row of its own in the conversation. Those rows — and every other row of the
 * pane's own voice kind, the closing count included — are gone: the conversation carries the real
 * messages and nothing else, and the bar is where the session reports itself. So this file reads the
 * verdicts on the WIRE, where they still are and always were (`verdictsIn` over the recorded frames),
 * and reads the PAGE as the absence of every voice-only row. What used to be "the row says
 * `lost(upstream-drop)` in AC-367's words" is now "the wire carries the verdict and the pane draws
 * nothing for it" — the same fact about the same pipeline, read at the end that survived.

 *
 * VERBATIM SO THE ATTRIBUTION IS EXACT. The client attributes a delivered message to the captions it
 * carries (`useVoiceRealtimeSession`): a caption whose words appear in the relayed text is claimed by
 * TEXT, and when the relayed text contains NO pending caption the client falls back to "everything
 * spoken since the last delivery" (`carried = matched.length > 0 ? matched : thought`). A REPHRASE
 * therefore hands seq5's one delivery every pending caption — seq0, seq1, seq3, seq4 — and drops
 * them all off the screen, which is the rewrite-attribution question and not this criterion. Relaying
