// Real Chromium against the real backend + Vite client started by playwright.config.ts (isolated data dir),
// recording through the app's own voice button. The recorder is the browser's own: Chromium is launched with a
// fake audio device whose samples come from the WAV playwright.config.ts wrote before the servers booted, so
// `getUserMedia` hands `MediaRecorder` a real stream and the app's own hook encodes what it hears.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE READS, said once because every claim below is bounded by it: the recogniser is answered in the
// browser (`page.route`), and the interface language is Chinese, so what is under test is the DISPLAY surface —
// which sentence a failure gets, how long it stays, what a fold hides, and what a failure does to the draft.
// The four upstream conditions are produced by one stand-in whose answer is swapped between legs; the app's own
// classification of them (the vocabulary, the envelope, the code→sentence mapping) belongs to four sibling
// criteria and is consumed here rather than reimplemented. This file reads the PAGE, never the server's
// classification. See the registration line printed at the end for the full list of what is and is not done.
//
// ONE PAGE FOR FOUR LEGS, deliberately: playwright.config.ts arms a 55s watchdog over the whole invocation (and
// a 60s goal gate above that), and e2e/voice-trim.spec.ts already measures 41s in this checkout. Re-opening a
// page and re-running onboarding per leg would spend that budget on the fixture instead of on the readings, so
// the legs share one context and one page and change only the stand-in's answer. The interceptors are
// registered once, per page, for the same reason — a second `page.route` on the same pattern would stack a
// second handler onto the first leg's closure.
