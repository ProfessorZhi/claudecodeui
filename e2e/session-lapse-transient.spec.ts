/**
 * The session-lapse policy against a REAL browser, a REAL server and a REAL JWT.
 *
 * `src/modules/auth/tests/sessionLapsePolicy.test.tsx` proves the rule against a stubbed
 * transport: only a server-side rejection may lapse the session, and a gateway 5xx, an
 * interception page or a dropped connection must leave the stored token and the signed-in
 * session alone. That file can only speak about the code path it stubs. Whether the rule holds
 * when the token is a credential the server really issued, the 502 is really what a gateway in
 * front of a restarting origin answers, and the 401 is really a signature the server refuses —
 * that is a question only a browser driving the shipped app against the shipped server can
 * answer, and it is what this spec answers.
 *
 * Two legs, one per direction:
 *
 *   (1) a live session plus a 502 on `GET /api/auth/user` ⇒ the app is NOT on the login form,
 *       the self-check keeps re-issuing the SAME read, and the stored token is untouched;
 *       once the fault is lifted the reload lands back on the signed-in shell.
 *   (2) a credential the real server rejects ⇒ the login page and the shipped session-expired
 *       sentence, i.e. the positive control that the 401 arm did not go dead.
 *
 * The account is a one-off created against this run's throwaway database, and the token the
 * legs replay is the one the real server hands back for a real credential check — never a
 * token minted here. Nothing about the failure is stubbed: the 502 is fulfilled at the network
 * boundary the browser would otherwise have crossed, and the 401 comes from the server's own
 * signature check.

/**
 * Loads `/` and stays at it until the readiness signal `ready()` is on screen, bounded by `budgetMs`
 * — and reports how many loads of the document that took.
 *
 * ONE `goto` IS NOT A GUARANTEE THAT THE APP WILL EVER RENDER, and treating it as one is the defect
 * this step exists for. `page.goto('/')` waits for `load`; the app itself is a Vite-served ES-module
 * graph that the browser is still fetching, transforming and evaluating at that moment, and a load
 * whose graph did not survive leaves a document with an empty `#root` that nothing will ever fill.
 * The failing run this task was filed against is exactly that: 118 of the graph's requests were
 * aborted with `net::ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED` about 420ms into the load, `main.tsx` never ran, and the
 * predicate below spent its whole fixed 15s counting reads from an app that had not started —
 * reporting `Received: 0`, which reads as a policy failure and was in fact a load failure. So a load
 * that produced no readiness is an ATTEMPT: the document is loaded again, and again, until `ready()`
 * is satisfied or `budgetMs` is gone.
 *
 * `ready` is a callback rather than a locator because the callers differ: leg 1 waits for a render
 * into `#root` (the only signal that exists before the reads it counts do), while the `beforeAll`
 * fixture and leg 2 wait for the login screen itself — the state their next step needs, which also
 * subsumes the render. `what` names that state for the log and the failure, so a red says which of
 * the file's boot steps never got to where it was going.
 *
 * THE RELOAD IS ALSO THE RIGHT RECOVERY FOR A MERELY SLOW BOOT, which is why the attempt window can
 * be short. The expensive half of a cold load is Vite's own transform of the module graph, and that
 * half is NOT lost when an attempt is discarded: the modules the attempt did fetch are already
 * transformed and cached by the dev server, so the next load pays the browser round trip and Vite's
 * revalidation rather than the transform again.
 *
 * The failure is thrown HERE, naming what the step saw — how many loads it made, that `what` never
 * arrived, how many reads the app never reached — so that a red distinguishes "the app never started"
 * from "the app started and the session policy lapsed", which the bare `Received: 0` of a counter
 * predicate could not.
 *
 * A load that throws is not special-cased: the navigation can lose the same race its module graph
 * loses, and a page that is mid-parse when `load` times out can still render during the attempt's
 * own window — so every attempt, thrown or not, ends in the same readiness check, and only a window
 * that saw no readiness at all is discarded. That is what keeps the count honest: a discarded load is
 * one that issued no read, so `userReads` can never be raised by a reload.
 *
 * `reads` is optional: leg 1 supplies a counter so its log carries the read count the criterion is
 * about, while a boot step with no read predicate omits it and the log says nothing about reads.
