/**
 * A replayed `X-Refreshed-Token` against a REAL browser, a REAL server and REAL JWTs.
 *
 * `src/modules/auth/tests/staleRefreshedTokenCannotDowngradeSession.test.tsx` proves the rule against a
 * stubbed transport: only a strictly newer, well-formed renewal may replace the stored token. That file
 * can speak only about the code path it stubs. Whether the rule holds when the credential is a real JWT
 * the shipped server really issued, when the response is delivered to the page the way a browser cache
 * would deliver it, and when the server's own response headers are the ones a cache decides on — that is
 * a question only a browser driving the shipped app against the shipped server can answer.
 *
 * Three legs:
 *
 *   (1) a response carrying an OLDER `X-Refreshed-Token` is delivered to the page — exactly what a cache
 *       replay looks like — and the stored token must be byte-for-byte unchanged and the session must stay
 *       signed in. The old client wrote the replayed token over the fresh one unconditionally, which is
 *       the reported "every refresh logs you out" defect.
 *   (2) a response carrying a NEWER `X-Refreshed-Token` must still be adopted and announced — the positive
 *       control that keeps ordinary renewal working, so leg (1) is not satisfied by refusing everything.
 *   (3) the server's own `/api/*` response carries `Cache-Control: no-store`, and the browser really treats
 *       it as uncacheable: an `only-if-cached` read of an endpoint that was just fetched misses.
 *
 * Both replayed tokens are REAL JWTs the shipped server issued to this run's account — the older from a
 * `POST /api/auth/login`, the newer from a `POST /api/auth/refresh` of the older, taken a beat later so
 * their `iat` claims order them strictly. Nothing here mints a token itself. Legs (1) and (2) replay the
 * headers through `page.route`, which is the browser's own cache stand-in: it hands the page exactly what
 * a cache would have handed it, without needing to arrange a real cache entry first.
