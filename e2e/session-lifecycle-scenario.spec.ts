/**
 * The BROWSER execution surface of the unified scenario runner.
 *
 * THE CLAIM. A transcript's reduction — a busy send that must not vanish, a queued command's
 * residue, the idempotence of repeated or reordered events, and the order-stability of a refresh
 * merged with live rows — is ONE property set that must hold for the SAME timeline whatever
 * surface drives it. `gap-scenario-runner-shared-timeline-pure-slice` delivered the PURE surface
 * (the store's own exported transitions, folded under vitest); this file delivers the other half:
 * a real Chromium page, loaded from this run's own Vite dev server, folding the
 * {@link ../src/shared/scenarios/sessionLifecycle.timeline} artifact that the pure surface imports
 * too — never a copy of it.
 *
 * WHY THE SAME MODULE, TWO RUNTIMES. The failure this runner exists to catch is a timeline that
 * exists twice and drifts. Here there is exactly one artifact and exactly one fold
 * (`foldSessionLifecycleTimeline`), and the only thing that differs between the surfaces is WHERE
 * the reductions come from: vitest binds them from `@/...` under Node's resolver, and this file
 * binds them from `/src/...` under Vite's, in Chromium. The element-wise comparison below is
 * therefore a statement about the app's own reduction agreeing with itself across two module
 * graphs, two transforms (esbuild-in-Vite vs tsx) and two JavaScript engines — which is where the
 * drift the artifact exists to prevent would actually show up.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SURFACE DOES **NOT** EXPRESS (AC3's escape hatch, stated rather than skipped).
 *
 *   1. A DOM-driven leg against the scripted upstream (`e2e/voiceRealtimeScriptedUpstream.ts`).
 *      NOT EXPRESSED. Alternative reading, taken here: the merged transcript LINES — the same
 *      value the DOM renders from, produced by the app's own `mergeSessionRows` inside the
 *      browser. Reason: the four invariants are properties of the reduction, not of a renderer;
 *      a DOM leg would need a signed-in session, a project and a real turn, and would read a
 *      *rendering* of the value instead of the value. (A second reason, measured rather than
 *      assumed: `voiceRealtimeScriptedUpstream.ts` holds NO timeline array — see Notes on the
 *      task — so the "second copy" the plan expected to delete there does not exist.)
 *
 *   2. Family ④'s `refresh` seam. PARTIALLY EXPRESSED — deliberately. `useSessionStore` exports
 *      no pure refresh, so BOTH surfaces supply the same one-line model (`server := fetched
 *      rows`), which is what the store's refresh path does. The comparison therefore pins that
 *      the two surfaces agree on the model, not that the model is production's. Alternative
 *      reading, taken here: on both surfaces the refreshed arm's merged transcript must equal the
 *      never-refreshed arm's (`merged === neverRefreshed`), which is the invariant itself; the
 *      production refresh path is exercised by the store's own tests.
 *
 * ZERO EGRESS. Two readings, both taken: the browser's own request route (every non-loopback
 * request is refused and named), and the SERVER-side guard this selection arms —
 * `e2e/support/egress-guard.mjs`, preloaded into the app server with `--import`, whose log for
 * THIS run is published as `QUAY_E2E_VOICE_REALTIME_EGRESS_LOG`. An existing-but-empty log is the
 * zero-egress reading; a positive control in the same test shows the very same module producing a
 * non-empty one, so "empty" cannot be confused with "the guard never loaded".
 *
 * Run: npx playwright test e2e/session-lifecycle-scenario.spec.ts
