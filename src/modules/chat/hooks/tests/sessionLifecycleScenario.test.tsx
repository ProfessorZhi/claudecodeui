/**
 * The PURE execution surface of the unified scenario runner.
 *
 * THE CLAIM. The transcript's reduction — a busy send that must not vanish, a
 * queued command's residue, the idempotence of repeated or reordered events, and
 * the order-stability of a refresh merged with live rows — is ONE property set
 * that must hold for the SAME timeline whatever surface drives it. This file is
 * the pure half: it replays the committed timeline (imported, never copied, from
 * {@link SESSION_LIFECYCLE_TIMELINE}) through the store's OWN exported pure
 * transitions, so a failure here is a statement about the production reduction
 * rather than about a second implementation of it.
 *
 * WHY PROPERTIES, NOT A CASE PER SHAPE. The four families each carry one
 * invariant and one falsifying "broken transition": the assertion is run twice,
 * once through the real transitions (must hold) and once through a deliberately
 * broken one (must throw). A family that no longer pins anything — because the
 * invariant went vacuous, or the broken transition stopped breaking it — fails
 * on the second run. This is the property-testing mandate the streaming
 * architecture proposal asks for in place of enumerating shapes.
 *
 * WHERE THE OTHER SURFACE IS. The browser half of the runner is
 * `gap-scenario-runner-playwright-executor-same-timeline`, which imports this
 * same module path from an e2e spec. §AC1's "two execution surfaces" is therefore
 * one surface delivered here and one delivered there; what is asserted here is
 * the property both depend on — the timeline is defined exactly once and every
 * reference to it goes through this module's path, never a copy.
 *
