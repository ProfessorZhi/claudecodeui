/**
 * Whether a row belongs to a work run.
 *
 * Membership is decided by the row's TYPE fields alone — `isThinking`,
 * `isToolUse`, `isSubagentContainer`, `isTaskNotification`. A row's text is
 * deliberately not consulted: a tool row whose prose has not arrived yet is
 * already a member, and an assistant body row is already a boundary, so a run's
 * edges are the same before and after the tail streams in.
 *
 * A task-notification row is a member for the same reason the others are: it is
 * a row *about* the work around it, not a thing said. A background shell's
 * terminal line lands directly behind the tool card that launched it, and while
 * it was a boundary it cut that run into two one-member fragments — the reader
 * saw the card's own header float free of its command. Absorbing it keeps the
 * run whole and still draws the line, because a run of one member is emitted as
 * that member itself.

 * which runs it before rendering so a run of work rows can be drawn as one
 * segment. The selection is a pure function of the rows' types, which is what
 * makes it stable across the streaming tail, and it keeps the run's rows
 * verbatim — unlike `groupConsecutiveTools` it never folds same-name calls into
 * an xN layer, so a run of N calls has N members. A run of exactly one member is
 * emitted as that member itself rather than wrapped, which keeps a lone tool row
 * rendering exactly as it does today.
 *
 * The segment's `key` is its first member's intrinsic key, so the segment has an
 * identity the tail cannot re-mint.
