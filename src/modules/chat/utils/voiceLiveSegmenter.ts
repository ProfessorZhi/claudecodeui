/**
 * The continuous-capture segmenter: the missing link between the streaming VAD's frame-by-frame
 * decisions and the segment pipeline's upload jobs.
 *
 * `voiceEndpoint.ts`'s `StreamingVad` answers "was this 20 ms frame speech?" and, from that,
 * where a sentence ends. `voiceSegments.ts`'s pipeline answers "what happens to a segment once it
 * is a job?" — ordinals, retries, reassembly. What neither owns is the step between them: turning
 * a live PCM stream into the *segments themselves*. That is this module, and it owns exactly five
 * rules, each of which is a decision rather than a detection one:
 *
 *   · FLUSH ON SILENCE (`DEFAULT_FLUSH_SILENCE_SEC`, 10 s). Once the buffered speech has been
 *     followed by this much continuous silence, it is emitted *however short it is*. This is the
 *     latency rule: without it a lone short utterance waits inside the buffer until the user
 *     presses stop, because the min-length floor below would otherwise step over every pause.
 *     The emitted segment does not carry the wait — it ends at the last speech frame, with only
 *     the usual trailing keep-gap. The wait after a segment is a property from a *real unit price*
 *     re-read (input ¥0.8 / output ¥2.7 per million tokens): a 15 s request costs ¥0.001–0.006, so
 *     a minute of speech cut into many requests is a fraction of a yuan a day. The recogniser's
 *     own latency (15–22 s on `dashscope-omni`) dwarfs the extra wait, so cost is not the reason
 *     to wait — but a cut is: a self-correction split across a pause is never resolved (see the
 *     constant below), so the flush errs late rather than early.
 *
 *   · MIN LENGTH (`DEFAULT_MIN_SEGMENT_SEC`, 20 s). A segment is not worth cutting at a *pause*
 *     until enough of it is speech. The original 30 s came from the same fixed-overhead cost model;
 *     the re-read above is why it drops to 20. While the buffered *speech* is under the floor, a
 *     pause does not end the segment: it is stepped over and kept (compressed, below). The silence
 *     flush above is the release valve for everything the floor would otherwise hold.
 *
 *   · CUT ON A PAUSE (`DEFAULT_CUT_PAUSE_SEC`, 2.0 s). Once the floor is reached, the segment ends
 *     at the first pause at least this long. A pause is the safest place a cut can land — no word
 *     is on it — so a pause cut carries no overlap.
 *
 *   · THE CEILING (`DEFAULT_MAX_SEGMENT_SEC`, 60 s). A run that reaches this much *emitted* audio
 *     with no long pause is force-cut at its quietest recent frame. A 60 s 16 kHz mono WAV is
 *     about 1.9 MB, comfortably inside `dashscope-omni`'s 10 MB whole-request budget. A forced
 *     cut lands inside speech by definition, so the next segment is pulled back across it by
 *     `OVERLAP_SEC` — the word on the cut appears in both halves for the text layer to dedupe.
 *
 *   · THE GAP FILTER (`DEFAULT_KEEP_GAP_SEC`, 1.0 s). A pause the min-length rule stepped over is
 *     silence the recogniser does not need in full. Gaps at or under the filter are kept
 *     sample-exact — a short pause is a punctuation cue (`pauseCues`), not waste — and only the
 *     excess of a *long* gap is dropped, down to the filter's length.
 *
 * WHY IT IS DRIVEN BY EVENTS AND NOT A SECOND DETECTOR. The frames' speech/silence decision is
 * the streaming VAD's, and a second copy of it here would be the drift the shared module exists
 * to prevent. So the segmenter is handed the audio (`push`) and the VAD's events, and it reads
 * boundaries straight off the events' sample offsets. The worklet that produces both is
 * `src/modules/chat/audio/voiceFrameProcessor.ts`.
 *
 * IT IS A PURE MODULE, AND IT IMPORTS ONLY THROUGH THE `@/` ALIAS. No DOM, no React, no clock,
 * no network: `push` is a function of the audio and the events. The `@/` alias (not a relative
 * path) is also what lets the offline truth harness load it unchanged — `experiments/voice-vad/
 * run.mjs` registers the same alias — so the module a browser runs is the module the T1 reading
 * is taken on.

/**
 * The shortest speech a segment may carry *before a pause ends it*. Below this the pause is
 * stepped over rather than cut on, so a short burst stays in the buffer waiting for either more
 * speech or the silence flush. It is a cost floor, not a latency one: the fixed ~407-token prompt
 * per request is why a segment is not cut at every breath. The original 30 s came from that model;
 * a re-read against the real unit price (input ¥0.8 / output ¥2.7 per million tokens) shows the
 * overhead is worth far less than that, so the floor drops to 20 s and `DEFAULT_FLUSH_SILENCE_SEC`
 * releases anything that never reaches it.

/**
 * The continuous silence, after buffered speech, that emits the buffer regardless of how short it

 * see text while still recording, not after a stop. It is measured in VAD frame counts rather than
 * against a wall clock, so a throttled (background) tab — where timers fire late and audio frames do
 * not — still flushes at the same point in the audio. The emitted segment ends at the last speech
 * frame; the wait itself is not carried into the upload.
 *
 * WHY 10 s, MEASURED. `docs/experiments/2026-10-04-voice-pause-split.md` drove the shipping
 * `dashscope-omni` adapter over a spoken self-correction (`改一下 A，嗯不对，应该是 B`) two ways,
 * paired on the same audio: sent whole, the correction resolves 60/60; cut at the pause (the cut
 * the segmenter makes when the pause exceeds this constant), it resolves 0/60 — the first half is
 * a standalone "change A" instruction and `dashscope-omni` carries no context across requests, so
 * nothing later can retract it. The loss is total at every tested pause (2, 5 and 10 s), so the
 * experiment's registered tie-break (no pause inside tolerance ⇒ least gap ⇒ tie broken to the
 * LARGER pause, because a later flush cuts fewer corrections and latency is the secondary term)
 * selects the largest tested value. The evidence is directional only (n=20 per cell).
