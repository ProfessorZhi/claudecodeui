/**
 * The C2 ContextPack judged against the transcript's OWN visibility rules, plus the two false forms
 * that keep the filter and the budget falsifiable.
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY BEING PINNED. `buildVoiceContextPack` answers one question — which rows of this
 * conversation could the person see said, and how much of them fits in the budget — and the answer
 * is only right if the rows it keeps are THE SAME ROWS the transcript itself puts in front of the
 * person. So the criteria here are not "does it return something": a pack that carried every row
 * including tool results would satisfy a shape-only assertion and would hand the voice model a wall
 * of tool output to reason about. Section 1 therefore judges the pack against the two predicates the
 * transcript already uses — `isWorkSegmentMember` and `shouldHideToolResult`, imported, on the SAME
 * fixture batch — and the fixture holds one row of every kind the transcript can render.
 *
 * THE TWO PREDICATES ARE CROSS-CHECKED AGAINST THE COMPOSITE. `groupWorkSegments` is what the
 * transcript actually runs before rendering; a row the primitive calls a work member is a row the
 * composite never emits as a bare item. Asserting the two agree is what catches a drift where the
 * grouping grows a rule the primitive does not have — the pack reads the primitive, so a drift
 * there would silently change what the voice model sees.
 *
 * THE BUDGET IS A LIMIT, NOT A TARGET. Section 2 drives ≥200 seeded random batches through the
 * builder at eight budgets (including budget 0 and budget 1) and asserts the pack never exceeds the
 * budget, that `chars` is the RENDERED length, and that the walk stops at the newest row that did
 * not fit rather than skipping it — which is what "newest-first until it no longer fits" means.
 *
 * THE FALSE FORMS ARE EXECUTED, NOT DESCRIBED. Section 3 writes a mutated copy of
 * `src/modules/chat/utils/voiceContextPack.ts` beside the suite and imports it: one arm turns the
 * budget check off (超预算时不截断), the other drops tool rows from the work-row exclusion (把工具
 * 调用/结果放进 pack). Each control runs the SAME reading through both arms — the mutated module and
 * the shipped one — so it cannot pass by being red for some unrelated reason, and both variants are
 * removed in a `finally` with an on-disk residue check.
