/**
 * What the activity dock should say, derived from two independent readings.
 *
 * The dock is the one surface that must never lie about a turn: it reads the
 * client's local "a turn is running" table *and* the freshness of the server's
 * evidence, and speaks about whichever is more honest. This module is that
 * decision, kept pure — it takes the local activity, the liveness the freshness
 * machine last computed, and the server-derived elapsed time, and returns the
 * state, the elapsed seconds to draw, and whether the stop control is operable.
 *
 * The rule it encodes: **a turn with no fresh evidence is `unreachable`, not
 * `in-turn`**. The benign default — keep showing the turn because the local
 * table still has it — is exactly what let a dead server keep the dock
 * "thinking". The elapsed reading is passed through untouched and is never
 * recomputed from a local clock here; when the caller freezes it (because the
 * server's `asOf` stopped advancing), it stays frozen.
 *
 * Used by chat's activity dock (`ActivityIndicator`) and, for the composer's
 * stop entry, by `ChatComposer`; its criterion is
 * `src/modules/chat/tests/activityDockUnreachable.test.tsx`.
