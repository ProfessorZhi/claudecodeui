/**
 * The C2 ContextPack: the part of the conversation the person could actually SEE
 * SAID, rendered as plain `角色：文本` lines, newest last, inside a character budget.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. The Realtime model that carries a person's words to Claude had no
 * idea what the session was about, so a turn like 「把那个改成三十秒」 reached Claude
 * with no referent (`docs/proposals/voice-realtime-segmented-relay-SPEC.md` §C2).
 * The pack is handed to the model as its `instructions` (the injection P0a-S3
 * validated), so 「那个」 has something to resolve against.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A PURE FUNCTION HERE, ON THE BROWSER SIDE. The rule for "what counts as
 * something said" already exists — the transcript's own work-run and tool-result
 * visibility rules — so this file READS those rules rather than restating them
 * ({@link isWorkSegmentMember}, `shouldHideToolResult`). A second implementation
 * would drift the moment either side changed.
 *
 * NO "LAST N TURNS". The budget is characters, taken newest-first until the next
 * row would not fit; a turn count would silently change what the model sees when
 * turns get longer, which is exactly what the SPEC rejects (D5).
