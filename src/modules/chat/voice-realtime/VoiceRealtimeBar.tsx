 * The fixed, compact Live Voice control bar (GOAL-033 / AC-316), rendered by

 * It is drawn in the composer's own shell (same padding, width cap, rounded
 * bordered container) at a fixed height, so entering Live Voice changes the
 * box's contents and nothing else: `[status] [wave · mm:ss · live caption]
 * [model] [Mute] │ [Exit]`. The caption is the last utterance the model heard,
 * truncated to its own flex cell — it can never push the row taller. There is
 * no draft-and-confirm step: a model-proposed `session_send` executes the
 * moment it is called, and its turn appears through the ordinary transcript.
 *
 * LEAVING IS NOT STOPPING. The trailing `Exit` leaves the live mode; the running
 * turn is the transcript row's own Stop, and this bar carries none. So Exit is
 * drawn apart from the controls to its left — behind a divider, and as the same
 * pure icon square the controls beside it are (`iconButtonClass`, `LogOut`), never
 * the solid red square a Stop is — because the one mistake this layout must not
 * invite is reading "leave the microphone" as "cancel the run".
 *
 * It owns no connection state (see `voice`); only the elapsed clock and the
 * level meter, both display-only, live here.
 *
 * `banner` is the one row allowed above the bar — the pending permission/question
 * surface, without which Live Voice would put an answerable prompt out of reach.
 *
 * WHAT THE BAR SAYS IS ONLY WHERE THE CONNECTION IS (operator's ruling, 2026-10-14). The status
 * cell reads the phase and nothing else — no stop's queue count, no refusal, no busy backlog, no
 * unanswered turn, no "heard but not forwarded" — because the page had become too much mixed
 * information in one place. Queue accounting belongs to the queue's own rows above the bar; the
 * words the model did not pass on are the transcript's business, not a fourth thing to read down
 * here. Failure is the one exception, and it is not a status: it replaces the caption line for as
 * long as it lasts, with a single sentence saying what to do. There is deliberately no reconnect
 * control and no auto-reconnect — a connection that died stays dead until the person leaves and
 * comes back.

            Leaving the mode, told apart from stopping the turn. The trailing group is fenced off
            from the controls beside it by a divider — separated by position, not by a different
            shape — so "leave the microphone" cannot be read as "cancel what Claude is doing". Exit
            itself is the same pure icon square as the control to its left (Mute): it shares
            `iconButtonClass` — same `h-10 w-10` target and same `text-foreground` — draws the
            leaving glyph `LogOut`, and carries no visible text. `title` and `aria-label` name it at
            every width. It is never the solid red square a Stop is. One wrapper (not a bare divider
            plus a button) so the fence costs a single gap, not two.
