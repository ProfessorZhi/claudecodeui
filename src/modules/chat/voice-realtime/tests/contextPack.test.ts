/**
 * AC-320's own entry point for the C2 ContextPack: the pack as the voice-realtime module consumes
 * it (`contextFrame` → the `context` wire frame).
 *
 * WHY A SECOND SUITE. `src/modules/chat/utils/tests/voiceContextPack.test.ts` is the builder's
 * exhaustive suite — 200+ seeded random batches and the two executed false forms. This file is the
 * criterion AC-320 names, and it answers the criterion's own reading rather than restating the
 * builder's: that the rows kept are the rows the transcript's fold rules keep, that the character
 * budget is a HARD cap on any input, and that a single over-long row is elided as
 * 首 70% + `…` + 尾 30% inside `rowCapChars`. It is deliberately smaller — the deep randomised
 * coverage lives in the builder's own file — but every case here is a real reading against the
 * shipped functions, not a restatement of them.
