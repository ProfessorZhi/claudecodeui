/**
 * AC-355 — the Live Voice transcript is honest, segment by segment (GOAL-043).
 *
 * THE CLAIM, in four parts, each of which the page currently gets wrong:
 *
 *   1. A ROW GOES WHERE ITS WORDS WERE SPOKEN. The endpoint answers its commits out of order, so a
 *      transcript can arrive for the sentence the person said FIRST long after the one they said
 *      third. Ordering rows by arrival — or by back-filling them at the bottom in the order their
 *      transcripts turned up — reads the person their own sentences shuffled. Every honest row (a
 *      hole, a refused utterance) carries the relay `seq` of the segment it is about, so it can be
 *      placed by it.
 *   2. ONLY WHAT THE MODEL FORWARDED IS DELIVERED. The realtime model may decline to relay part of
 *      what it heard. Those words were heard and went nowhere — and they are NOT a row of this
 *      client's own (this task, `gap-live-voice-remove-transcript-caption-rows`): the bottom voice
 *      bar shows the live transcript, and the composer is handed the unclaimed words back on Exit.
 *   3. A SEGMENT WITH NO TRANSCRIPT IS RECORDED AT ITS OWN SPOKEN PLACE. A commit the endpoint
 *      refused, or one it accepted and never answered, leaves a hole in the transcript that reads
 *      exactly like a pause. The reading is kept at the segment's own spoken place, and a transcript
 *      that arrives LATE retracts it, because a late transcript is not a defect. (Since the operator's
 *      ruling of 2026-10-14 the hole is no longer DRAWN — the conversation carries the real messages
 *      only, and the bar is where the session reports itself — so these cases read the algebra.)
 *   4. LEAVING BY THE EXIT BUTTON IS COUNTED, NOT DRAWN. The close reading used to be computed only
 *      when the SERVER closed the socket: the user's own Exit reset the segment counter and closed
 *      the socket before the count was taken. That count is still taken on both paths and still
 *      written to the console; what it no longer does is put a row in the conversation.
 *
 * WHY THESE READINGS. `seq` is the client's own segment number, minted when the segment is opened
 * and carried on the wire in both directions (`segment_start`/`audio`/`segment_end` out,
 * `caption.seq` and `segment_ack.seq` back — the pairing landed with
 * `gap-live-voice-caption-segment-attribution-by-item-id`), which is what makes "where it was
 * spoken" a reading rather than a guess from timestamps that two clocks produce.
 *
 * THE FALSE FORM, AND WHY THE FIRST GROUP IS FIRST. The defect these readings exist for is exactly
 * "order by arrival / back-fill at the bottom in arrival order". The first group is written so that
 * an arrival-ordered (or bottom-back-filled) implementation fails it: the fixtures hand the rows in
 * an order different from the order the sentences were spoken, and the assertions read the spoken
 * one — the hook's own caption order, and the placement of a refused row above the delivered turn it
 * was spoken before. (The red was demonstrated by making the capstone's own sort the identity and
 * re-running the group; see the task's Notes.)
