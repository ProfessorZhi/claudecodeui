/**
 * AC-367 — a segment the graded ACK reported UNCERTAIN or LOST is shown honestly (GOAL-043).
 *
 * THE CLAIM. AC-366 gave the page a graded per-segment verdict on the wire —
 * `segment_ack { seq, state }` with four states — and until this task the page read only two of them
 * (`committed`, `dropped`). The two it ignored are the ones a broken connection produces:
 *
 *   - `written` — UNCERTAIN. The segment's audio and its commit were written to an upstream socket
 *     that died before the endpoint answered. The bridge may still replay it, so the honest wording
 *     is "retrying this part" — never "not recognised", which would blame the recogniser for a wire
 *     that may yet carry the audio.
 *   - `lost` — TERMINAL, with a reason. `connection-closed`: the voice connection was not open when
 *     the segment ended, so its frames never left the page — and the bar has to say the connection is
 *     down rather than keep reading "Listening…" over a microphone with nowhere to send.
 *     `upstream-drop`: the frames were written but the bridge spent its replay budget, so the words
 *     never reached the model.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG. A lost segment produced no caption, so it left no reading at all: the person's
 * sentence simply vanished, reading exactly like a pause, and the bar went on looking live. The fix
 * was a row of the segment's own (`type:'system'`, no words, no bubble) placed where the segment was
 * spoken, carrying the state; and `lost(connection-closed)` also flips the connection to
 * disconnected.
 *
 * WHERE THAT ROW IS NOW (operator's ruling, 2026-10-14, `gap-voice-ui-strip-to-caption-and-connection-state`).
 * The conversation carries the real messages and nothing else, so the row is NO LONGER DRAWN — the bar
 * is where the session reports itself. Everything this file is about survives as a READING: the hook
 * still grades a segment (`segmentOutcomes`), `voiceTranscriptRows` still marks the row it would have
 * drawn, and `lost(connection-closed)` still flips the bar to disconnected. The cases below read the
 * readings and, for the drawing, assert its absence.
 *
 * WHY A LOST SEGMENT IS NOT AN UNRECOGNISED ONE, which is the whole task. `dropped` means the
 * endpoint WAS handed the audio and answered with no words — the blame is the recogniser's. `lost`
 * means the audio never got there — the blame is the connection's. Collapsing the two (the false
 * form below: handling a `lost` frame the way a `dropped` one is handled) both mislabels the failure
 * and, worse, hides it: the person is told their speech was not transcribed when in fact it never
 * arrived, so "say it again into a working microphone" is the one thing that would help and the one
 * thing the copy does not suggest.
 *
 * NOT BACK-FILLED. A lost segment has no transcript, so there are no words of the person's to hand
 * back: `collectUndeliveredUtterances` reads captions, so a lost segment contributes nothing to the
 * composer draft by construction — asserted here so the invariant cannot be broken silently.
 *
 * THE FALSE FORM, AND THE FIRST GROUP. Every case in the first group is written so that an
 * implementation handling a `lost` frame as a `dropped` one fails: a lost verdict is asserted NOT to
 * appear in `unrecognizedSeqs` and to appear in `segmentOutcomes` instead, and — non-vacuity — a real
 * `dropped` verdict is asserted to still mark. (The red was demonstrated by making the hook's `lost`
 * branch call `markSegmentUnrecognized` and re-running; see the task's Notes.)
 *
 * Frames are driven through the REAL wire type (`VoiceRealtimeSegmentAck`), not a hand-written shape,
 * so the test cannot drift from what AC-366 emits.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/modules/chat/voice-realtime/tests/voiceSegmentLostState.test.tsx
