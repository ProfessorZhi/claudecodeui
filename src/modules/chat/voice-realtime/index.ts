/**
 * The browser's Live Voice control plane (GOAL-031/AC-310-315; GOAL-033/AC-316-317).
 *
 * Three public symbols: the hook that owns the `/voice-realtime` connection, the
 * fixed compact bar `ChatInterface` renders in place of `ChatComposer` while Live
 * Voice mode is active, and the caption type the pane turns into transcript rows.
 * The hook is exported because the pane — not the bar — owns the connection: the
 * transcript it also renders has to show what the model heard (AC-317), and a
 * connection owned by the bar could not reach it.
 *
 * The `placeCaptions` helpers are the pane's row algebra: the real messages (the delivered ones
 * marked as spoken) plus one HONEST row per segment the transcript cannot account for — a REFUSED
 * utterance gets a row of its own so the loss is countable, and so does a segment that came back
 * with no transcript at all, so a silence is not read as a pause. The person's spoken words are
 * never carried by a row of the client's own; the bottom voice bar shows the live transcript. Plus
 * the edge reader the pane and the hook share: the words a leave never delivered, which
 * `ChatInterface` puts back into the composer's draft. All of it is entered through
 * `voiceTranscriptRows`.
 *
 * `VoicePendingMessageCard` is the ONE read-only card the relay's hold draws (ruling 2026-10-14):
 * while the session is busy every spoken sentence is merged into one message and this shows what
 * that message says right now. It stands where the per-utterance withdrawal control used to — a
 * stack offering one button per sentence, which is exactly what the ruling abolished. The pane owns
 * the text (it owns the connection) and hands it to the bar's `pendingMessage` slot.
