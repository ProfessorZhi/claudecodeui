/**
 * Places the HONEST state rows of a Live Voice session at the SPOKEN position of the segment each is
 * about, instead of interleaving them with the real rows by time or stacking them at the bottom.
 *
 * WHAT ROWS. The row that carries a spoken sentence is the real message the model relayed; this
 * module never invents a second copy of words the transcript already shows. What is left for it are
 * the rows that state a fact the real transcript cannot — a segment the proxy REFUSED (never
 * delivered anywhere), a segment the relay answered with no transcript, a segment the graded ACK
 * reported uncertain or lost — and, while the session has not yet written the turn for them, the
 * words of a delivery whose real message the pane is not showing at all. See
 * {@link undeliveredUtteranceRows}, {@link unrecognizedSegmentRows}, {@link segmentOutcomeRows},
 * {@link deliveredMessageRows}.
 *
 * WHY NOT BY TIME. These rows used to be interleaved with the real ones by TIME, on the reading that
 * a row belongs beside the real rows stamped around it. Two clocks make that a lie: a voice row's
 * time is when the BROWSER first saw the segment, while a real user row's time is when the CLI TURN
 * began — later by the server's coalescing window and by however long the CLI queue made the turn
 * wait. A row about a segment spoken while Claude was still answering the previous message was
 * therefore stamped EARLIER than that message's own row, and interleaved ABOVE it.
 *
 * THE PLACE A ROW BELONGS IS THE SEGMENT IT IS ABOUT. Both kinds of row carry one key that says so —
 * an honest row its own relay `seq` (or the utterance's, from the caption it was built from), and a
 * delivered row the `seq` of the utterances its delivery took over — so the rows can be ordered by
 * what the person actually said, in the order they said it, without either clock being trusted. Only
 * the rows that carry such a key anchor a placement; everything else keeps its place in the real
 * transcript and never pulls a row past it, which is what makes an unreadable timestamp harmless
 * here. A connection with no seq information at all keeps the placement this module has always used
 * ({@link placeCaptionsChronologically}): every pending row after the whole real transcript.
 *
 * Order within the real rows and within rows that share a position is preserved, and the whole
 * algebra is entered through {@link voiceTranscriptRows}.
 *
 * WHERE THESE ROWS GO NOW (operator's ruling, 2026-10-14). `ChatInterface` no longer renders them:
 * the conversation is the real messages and nothing else, and the Live Voice page carries only the
 * bar. The algebra stays because it is the shared reading of a session's rows — the lifecycle
 * scenario lane drives `voiceTranscriptRows` on both the browser and the node side and compares the
 * two — so what a delivery accounts for is still asked in exactly one place.

/**
 * The transcript a Live Voice session puts on screen: the real messages (the delivered ones marked
 * as spoken), the segments the proxy REFUSED, the segments that came back with no transcript, the
 * segments the graded ACK reported UNCERTAIN or LOST (AC-367) — ordered by WHAT WAS SAID, in the
 * order it was said.
 *
 * THE ONE ENTRY POINT. Every rule above is a step of this; the pane calls this and nothing else, so
 * the order of the steps cannot drift between the rows that depend on each other (a delivery must be
 * marked before the refused rows are read against the marked rows).
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE. The person's spoken words are never carried TWICE: an utterance reaches the
 * transcript the one way anything else does, as the real message the model relayed, and the carrier
 * row {@link deliveredMessageRows} draws is the stand-in for that message only while the transcript
 * is not showing it. The rows this adds are otherwise the ones that state a fact the real transcript
 * cannot — a segment the proxy refused, one the relay answered with no words, one the connection
 * reported lost.
 *
 * WHY POSITION AND NOT TIME OR "THE BOTTOM". `ChatInterface` used to stack everything pending after
 * the whole real transcript, on the true observation that the two row kinds carry two different
 * clocks (see {@link placeCaptionsChronologically}). That is right about the clocks and wrong about
 * the conclusion: stacking is stable, but it reads as though everything still pending was said after
 * everything already delivered, and with several segments pending it also loses their order. The
 * rows carry a key that says which segment each is about, so they can be placed by it: each row goes
 * where the person said it, and a row that carries no such key (the opening transcript, Claude's
 * replies) keeps its place and never pulls a row past it.
 *
 * A CONNECTION WITH NO SEQ INFORMATION — continuous mode, or a proxy built before the pairing — has
 * no position to place by, and gets the placement this module has always used: the pending rows trail
 * the real transcript, in sorted order, through {@link placeCaptionsChronologically}, with the
 * unrecognized rows after them (there is nothing for them to be spoken "between").
 *
 * NO LONGER RENDERED. `ChatInterface` renders the session's own messages directly (operator's ruling,
 * 2026-10-14), so nothing in the running page calls this. It is kept as the one reading of what a
 * session's rows ARE — what a delivery accounts for, which words never became a message — which the
 * lifecycle scenario lane drives on both the browser and the node side.
