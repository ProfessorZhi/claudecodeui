 *     segment, so its words may yet be transcribed. `written` ≠ `committed`.
 *   - `committed` — the endpoint took the audio (`input_audio_buffer.committed`). Whether words come
 *     of it is still open, so the client keeps waiting on the transcript.
 *   - `lost` — the segment will never be transcribed, and `reason` names the failure (never the same
 *     as "no words came of it"): `connection-closed` (the upstream socket was not open when the
 *     segment ended, so the frames were never written) or `upstream-drop` (the reconnect/replay
 *     budget was spent and the bridge gave up on ever learning the segment's words).
 *   - `dropped` — the proxy or the endpoint refused the commit, or reported no words for it; this is
 *     the page's not-recognised row, not a connection outcome.
 *
 * `reason` stays a loose string: `dropped` carries its own codes in it
 * (`commit-refused`, `empty-transcript`), so it cannot be the `lost` union alone.
