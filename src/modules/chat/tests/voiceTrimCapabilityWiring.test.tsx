/**
 * The audio-file entry travels the ONE capture path, and the recogniser's declaration decides what
 * that path does to a long pause.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE MEASURES. The trim itself — the batch re-encode of a finished clip — is gone:
 * `a88f5c2a` made segment-then-commit the only input path, and the audio is cut by the shared VAD
 * and uploaded as 16 kHz PCM WAV segments. What survives of the capability's say is the segmenter's
 * GAP FILTER, and that is what is read here: a stepped-over pause longer than the keep length is
 * compressed for a recogniser that declares `destructive`, and kept whole for one that does not.
 * The two arms below differ only in the declaration `effectivePauseCuesDeclaration()` returns, so
 * the bytes the recogniser is handed are a reading of the capability and not of the audio.
 *
 * Everything the chain needs is doubled below (the decoder; the recogniser; the declaration) because
 * jsdom has no audio stack, no offline recogniser and no published voice profile. The segmenter and
 * the VAD between them are the shipping modules — this file does not re-implement the cut, it
 * observes the WAV that leaves it.
