/**
 * AC-151's criterion: every code the shipped vocabulary names has copy in all twelve languages, no
 * code falls back to a sentence built out of the transport, and the composer shows the sentence the
 * code selects — in the user's language, with the status still kept for a technical line.
 *
 * WHAT IS BEING READ, AND WHY IT NEEDS A READING AT ALL. The composer used to say
 * `Transcription failed: transcribe 502 (UNSUPPORTED_MIME)`. That sentence is not a translation of
 * anything: it is the transport's vocabulary (a verb and a number) shown to a user who needs to know
 * what to change, and it is the same sentence in all twelve languages. The fix has two halves that
 * fail independently — copy that exists for a code (the locales) and a mapping that picks the right
 * copy (the frontend) — so this file reads both, and each half is read through the other: the code
 * set here is the SHIPPED runtime vocabulary, never a list kept beside it, and the twelve languages
 * are the SHIPPED `languages` list, never a hand-picked subset.
 *
 * THE VOCABULARY IS THE INPUT, NOT A COPY OF THE INPUT. `AsrErrorCode` is a type and a type is
 * erased; the runtime answer is `ASR_ERROR_CODES` from `@shared/asr/asrRegistry`, value-imported
 * below. Every reading here iterates that constant, which is what makes false form (1) work: add a
 * member to the vocabulary and the coverage reading reddens over twelve missing cells with no edit
 * to this file. A hand-written array here would make that reading true for the wrong reason forever.
 *
 * THE LOCALES ARE READ AS DATA, NOT THROUGH THE TRANSLATOR. The coverage and identity readings
 * (`AC2`, `AC3`) read the imported `chat.json` objects directly, so a missing key cannot be hidden by
 * a fallback language. The composer reading (`AC4`) is the opposite on purpose: it goes through the
 * real `ChatComposer`, the real `useVoiceInput` and a real i18next instance whose `fallbackLng` is
 * OFF — with a fallback language left on, a locale missing `voice.errors.unknown` would silently
 * render English and this file's central equality would hold over a locale that has no copy at all.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO. AC7 asks for the exit code of five existing composer criteria plus
 * `npm run test:client`, `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint`; AC6's residue half is a
 * `git status --porcelain` reading. All of those are SUBPROCESSES and a working tree, and AC1
 * requires this file to start none — so AC7's exits and the working-tree reading are taken by the
 * worker outside this file and recorded in the task's completion record. What IS read here is the
 * half that can be: the three mutation phases run as in-memory clones, and `shipped-intact` below
 * re-reads the shipped data after they have all run, which is the in-file face of "no residue".
 *
 * THE FAILURE PAYLOAD IS CAPTURED ON THE SHIPPED PRODUCER. AC4(c) needs the payload a refusal
 * actually carries, not one written out in this file: `useVoiceInput` is driven directly for that
 * reading and its `onError` argument is kept. The composer reading beside it is a second mount of
 * the same chain over the same fake answer, because the composer owns its error callback and does
 * not hand it out — one answer, read at both ends of the chain.
 *
 * Run: npx vitest run src/modules/chat/tests/voiceErrorMessages.test.tsx
