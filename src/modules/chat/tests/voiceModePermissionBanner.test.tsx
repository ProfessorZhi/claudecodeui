/**
 * A pending AskUserQuestion stays ANSWERABLE while Live Voice is active.
 *
 * THE CLAIM. Entering Live Voice replaces the whole composer subtree with
 * `VoiceRealtimeBar` (AC-316's mutually-exclusive swap), and the strip that
 * renders the only answerable surface — `PermissionRequestsBanner`, which
 * registers `AskUserQuestionPanel` — lived inside `ChatComposer` alone. So the
 * moment voice mode came on, the pending prompt was on screen in the transcript
 * as a read-only record while nothing on it could be clicked. A spoken turn
 * reported exactly that ("I can see the dialog but I cannot press it") and the
 * question was recorded Skipped. The banner is now drawn above the bar; answering
 * there runs the ordinary decision path and neither leaves voice mode nor
 * reconnects the voice link.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE. AC-316's swap is a real behaviour and the fix has to keep it:
 * the composer textarea must be gone in voice mode (that is the falsifying half),
 * and the panel must still be present (the claim). Both are read against the REAL
 * `ChatInterface` — the hook doubles below hand the pane the network state it
 * would otherwise fetch, while `ChatComposer`, `VoiceRealtimeBar`,
 * `PermissionRequestsBanner` and `AskUserQuestionPanel` are the shipping code.
 *
 * WHY THE REQUEST ARRIVES AFTER THE ENTRY. The composer hides its own input row
 * (Live Voice entry included) while an AskUserQuestion is pending, so the prompt
 * that has to stay answerable cannot be on screen before voice mode is entered:
 * it lands over the socket DURING a voice session, which is exactly the reported
 * shape ("I can see the dialog but cannot press it"). The cases below therefore
 * enter voice first and deliver the request into the live mode.
 *
 * TWO SEPARATE CASES. The first reads the answerable surface and the decision
 * payload; the second reads that answering did not disturb the connection. They
 * fail for different reasons, so they are kept apart rather than merged.
