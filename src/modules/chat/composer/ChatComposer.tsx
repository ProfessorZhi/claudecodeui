          Why this conversation is read-only, and the one command that changes that.

          A conversation a Claude Code background job is running cannot be resumed:
          the CLI exits 1 and says so only on stderr, which this app drops, so the
          send path would report `Resident process exited (error)` after the user
          had already typed. Saying it here, before anything is typed, is the whole
          point — the composer is disabled and this is the reason, not a refusal
          that arrives once the user has committed to a message.

          The command is drawn as text beside the sentence, not only inside it: the
          sentence is translated and the command is not, and a user who would rather
          type it than copy it needs it verbatim. `data-occupied-job-id` and
          `data-occupied-pid` publish the same two facts structurally, so a reader
          (or a criterion) can compare them with the listing that produced them
          without parsing copy.

          It disappears with `occupiedBy`: the poll behind `useSessionHosts` re-reads
          the listing every second, so the moment the job is stopped this notice, the
          disabled input and the status bar's Start button all come back together —
          no reload, and no local "dismissed" flag that could outlive the state it
          describes.

          On the compact tier the replay pair gets a row of its own between the box and the footer.

          It has nowhere to live inside the compact footer — that row is exactly the six controls that
          send a message and may not wrap — so without this the arrival of a recording is what pushed
          the footer into a second line. The row exists only while `clipSlot` holds something (a clip
          only exists because the mic produced one), and it is the row that grows and shrinks: the
          footer's own height and position are the same with a recording as without one. It may wrap
          *between* its two tracks, which is the move the footer is forbidden, not this row.

          One renderer, not two: the pair is drawn here on the compact tier and in the tools group on
          the wide one, off the same `clipSlot`/`clipPlayState` the hook owns, so exactly one set of
          replay controls is ever on screen — and therefore exactly one set in the accessibility tree.
          The draw itself is the `clipRow` value above, which the inline-tools tier mounts inside the

          `shrink-0` and the box is `flex-nowrap`. On the wide tier the previous
          wrapping row is kept exactly as it was.

          On the wide tier the *left group* may take a second line of its own, which is
          what `flex-wrap` here buys. The box's own `flex-wrap` only decides where the
          two groups go; it cannot break a group, and a group whose children may not
          shrink (the replay pair declares `shrink-0`, and an icon button cannot go
          below its own icon) then pushes the box's content past its edge instead of
          moving down. Measured with the window at 768 and the sidebar open — the box
          445px wide — one recording's pair in this group read
          `scrollWidth 470 / clientWidth 445`: 25px of content the box would have
          scrolled sideways, invisible without a horizontal scroll gesture. That box is
          narrower than `COMPACT_TIER_WIDTH_PX`, so the compact tier now takes it and
          the wrap never arises; and because the same measurement decides the boxed-in
          wide window (a 1024px window with the sidebar open leaves a 701px box, at
          which the pair wrapped too), the arrangement follows the box rather than the
          window. Wrapping the group is still the move the wide tier makes if a box
          between the threshold and the crossing ever reaches it, and it leaves every
          reading that has no pair to fit on one line: a recording only ever arrives
          because the mic produced one, and the two groups' placement, the 93px height
          and the 1280 footer are unchanged without it.
