/**
 * The ONE committed session-lifecycle timeline.
 *
 * THE CLAIM. A transcript is reduced from three sources — the persisted
 * transcript, the live socket, and the voice caption stream — and the same
 * sequence of user actions must reduce to the same screen no matter which
 * execution surface drives it (a pure reducer under vitest, a browser under
 * Playwright). The failure mode that motivated this artifact is a timeline that
 * exists twice: each surface carries its own hand-written copy, they drift, and
 * a fix proved on one surface says nothing about the other. So the timeline is
 * DATA here, at a path each surface imports — never copied — and the surfaces
 * keep only the assertion code.
 *
 * WHY `src/shared/scenarios/`. It is neutral ground: reachable from a frontend
 * module as `@/shared/scenarios/sessionLifecycle.timeline` and from a root-level
 * e2e spec as `../src/shared/scenarios/sessionLifecycle.timeline`. It must stay
 * import-clean — no runtime imports at all, at most `import type`, which the
 * bundler and the e2e transform both erase — so importing it never drags a
 * frontend module into a Playwright process or a Playwright helper into the app.
 *
 * WHAT IS HERE. The timeline is organised into FAMILIES, one per invariant the
 * pure execution surface asserts (the browser surface drives the same families
 * through its own events). Each family is a fixed sequence of typed events over
 * literal timestamps — no wall-clock reads — plus the initial server/realtime
 * state the sequence runs against, and the human-readable `invariant` it pins.
 * A surface replays a family by folding its events through the store's exported
 * pure transitions; it must not re-implement the fold.
 *
 * FAMILY ①  busy-send          — a send while the process is busy keeps its text
 *                                through `command_lifecycle: started`.
 * FAMILY ②  queued-command     — `queued → running → completed` leaves no residue,
 *                                on the socket side or the voice pending side.
 * FAMILY ③  event-ordering     — repeated / reordered / late events reduce
 *                                idempotently: never a second lifecycle row.
 * FAMILY ④  refresh-merge      — a refresh merged with live rows is element-wise
 *                                equal to the same rows never refreshed.
