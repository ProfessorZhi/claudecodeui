/**
 * AC-166: the server boundary, measured on a real server process.
 *
 * Every other criterion in this module drives the host layer in-process. This
 * one drives the thing an operator actually runs — `tsx server/index.ts` as a
 * child process, with its own temporary database, its own home, and a real
 * Claude CLI behind it — and then stops it two ways:
 *
 *  1. `SIGTERM`, which is the graceful path: the server's shutdown closes every
 *     host with `server-shutdown` and stops the scopes it owns, so the resident
 *     process must be gone and the reason must be on the record.
 *  2. `SIGKILL`, which is the path the graceful one cannot cover: nothing of the
 *     server runs, so whatever it left behind is orphaned, and the only thing
 *     that can reap it is the next server's start-up sweep.
 *
 * Then it restarts and reads what a client would read: the session is still
 * stored as resident, the listing says it is not running and why, and the next
 * `chat.send` opens a *new* process rather than reusing the dead one's pid.
 *
 * ## Why the group kill spares the session
 *
 * The AC says to signal the service's process group, and this criterion does —
 * with one member excepted, the resident session's own subtree. That exception
 * is measured, not stylistic: `systemd-run --user --scope` `exec`s the target in
 * the same PID, and neither the SDK nor the scope hook passes `detached`, so the
 * CLI inherits the server's process group (`ps -o pid,pgid` on a live session
 * shows one pgid for the whole tree). A literal group kill therefore reaps the
 * session along with the server, which makes the thing this leg exists to
 * measure — the next boot's sweep — unreachable: the transient scope is
 * collected the moment its last process dies, so there would be nothing left to
 * sweep and the reading would be vacuously clean. Sparing the session is what
 * makes the residue real, and the residue is the subject.
 *
 * Only the session is spared: the wrapper chain (`npm exec` → `sh` → `tsx` →
 * the server) is killed outright, so the server never runs its shutdown and the
 * leg really is the hard-kill path.
 *
 * ## What would make this criterion lie
 *
 * A green run that never reached the mock endpoint, a "gone" reading taken from
 * a host record instead of `/proc`, or a budget guard that could not fail. Each
 * is closed by a positive control: the mock counts the requests it answers, the
 * pid readings come from `/proc/<pid>/stat`, "alive before the term" is printed
 * before the signal, the budget threshold is asserted on both sides, and the
 * per-run control session proves the reason field is not filled for every row.
