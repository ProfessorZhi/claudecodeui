/**
 * Criterion for the host-listing endpoint (AC-156): `GET /api/session-hosts`.
 *
 * The endpoint is a read port over the host layer, and the two things that make
 * it worth a criterion are the two things a listing built from the run registry
 * would get wrong:
 *
 *   - a host exists *after* its run has ended. A Claude turn whose terminal
 *     `complete` frame has landed while the run's promise is still pending is
 *     `lingering` on the host layer and `isProcessing === false` in the run
 *     registry — so a listing that maps the registry cannot contain it, and the
 *     case below fails rather than passing by omission.
 *   - a closed host is readable for a while and then is not. The window is a
 *     read-time comparison against an injected clock, so both sides of it are
 *     reachable without waiting anything out.
 *
 * Everything below is driven through production seams: the runs are dispatched
 * through `createProviderRuntimeService` (the same entry point the chat handler
 * uses) and registered in the real `chatRunRegistry`, the app mounts the real
 * `authenticateToken`, and the listing is fetched over HTTP. Only the provider
 * runtimes are forged, because the criterion is about the host layer rather than
 * about any provider's CLI — the four runtime files are untouched.
