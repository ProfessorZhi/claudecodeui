/**
 * The MCP gateway's stage-3 read tools (AC-245).
 *
 * This module owns the one statement of "which read tools exist at stage 3":
 * {@link MCP_STAGE3_READ_TOOLS} names each tool with the scope it requires, and
 * {@link registerMcpReadTools} installs exactly those names through the audited
 * registration seam AC-244 landed. A later task that fills in `overview`,
 * `run_get` or `quay_snapshot` replaces a handler here, and must NOT rename a
 * tool, because the name set is a contract the criteria compare against
 * `tools/list` byte for byte. The set has grown exactly once on purpose —
 * `ui_last_opened_session` (gap-mcp-ui-last-opened-session) — and the criteria
 * that pinned the old size (the stage-3 count and the error-probe table) were
 * updated with it; a further addition must do the same rather than slip in.
 *
 * Every tool in this module is READ-ONLY. The four implemented ones answer from
 * the services the composition root injects (projects, providers' sessions,
 * session hosts, the chat run registry) and never write anything. `overview` and
 * `quay_snapshot` are AC-247's: when the deps carry the quay runner and activity
 * store, `registerMcpReadTools` routes them to `mcp-overview-tools.js`'s real
 * handlers; when those are absent, they keep their body-table refusal with a
 * named `MCP_TOOL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` code. `run_get` is AC-248's and is routed the
 * same way to `mcp-run-get.js` when the deps carry its bag; until then it keeps
 * the same refusal.
 *
 * `ui_last_opened_session` (gap-mcp-ui-last-opened-session) is one of the tools
 * this table GAINED after AC-245 rather than having a handler replaced: it is
 * routed to `mcp-ui-tools.js` when the deps carry the browser pointer reader,
 * and keeps the same named refusal otherwise. Its summary is `session_get`'s own
 * reading ({@link buildSessionDetail}), so the two can never drift apart.
 *
 * `ui_visible_context` (gap-mcp-ui-visible-context) and `ui_clients_list`
 * (gap-mcp-ui-clients-list) are the other two: the observer and the discoverer
 * of the connected browsers, routed to `mcp-ui-visible-context.js` and
 * `mcp-ui-clients-list.js` when the deps carry the round trip, and keeping the
 * same named refusal otherwise. `session_search` (gap-mcp-session-search) is the
 * third GAINED after AC-245 and the first read tool that spans every project at
 * once: routed to `mcp-session-search.js` when the deps carry the conversation
 * search engine, and keeping the same named refusal otherwise. This module
 * GAINING a tool is deliberate and
 * costs three edits in tandem (this table, `mcp-tool-annotations.ts`, and
 * `mcp-tool-error-codes.ts`, whose records are total over the name union), plus
 * the size pins the criteria hold — never a silent addition.
 *
 * Two text-shaping helpers are exported because the criterion drives them
 * directly as well as through a tool: {@link paginateMcpText} (the 4000-character
 * cursor protocol) and {@link formatMcpTime} (the relative + ISO pair every time
 * field carries).
 *
 * Cross-module access goes through the barrels (`@/modules/projects/index.js`
 * and friends) — except for the shared vocabulary in `@/shared/types.js`, which
 * is not a module and is imported directly everywhere in this codebase.

/**
 * Registers every stage-3 read tool exactly once.
 *
 * The scope comes from {@link MCP_STAGE3_READ_TOOLS} — the table is the one
 * place the pair (name, scope) is written down, and the body table is keyed by
 * the same names under a `satisfies`, so a tool added to one and not the other
 * is a type error rather than a silently missing registration.
 *
 * `overview` and `quay_snapshot` are AC-247's. When the injected deps are wired
 * with the quay runner and the activity store, those two names are registered by
 * {@link registerMcpOverviewTools} — the real handlers, with their metadata
 * passed down from this same table so the tool set stays one statement. When the
 * deps are NOT wired (AC-240/244/245's mounts), the two keep their body-table
 * refusal, so those criteria read exactly what they read before this task.
 * Either way the registered NAME SET is unchanged — this replaces handlers, it
 * does not add or rename a tool.
 *
 * `run_get` is AC-248's and follows the same routing: when `deps.runGet` is
 * supplied it is registered by `mcp-run-get.js`'s real handler, otherwise it
 * keeps the body-table refusal. `ui_last_opened_session` follows it too: when
 * `deps.uiLastOpened` is supplied it is registered by `mcp-ui-tools.js`, and
 * otherwise it keeps the body-table refusal. `ui_visible_context` follows the
 * same routing through `mcp-ui-visible-context.js` and `deps.uiVisibleContext`,
 * and `ui_clients_list` through `mcp-ui-clients-list.js` and
 * `deps.uiClientsList`. `session_search` (gap-mcp-session-search) follows the
 * same routing through `mcp-session-search.js` and `deps.sessionSearch`. The
 * registered NAME SET is the table either way.
