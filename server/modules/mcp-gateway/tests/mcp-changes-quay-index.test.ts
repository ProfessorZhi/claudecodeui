/**
 * `changes`' Quay source: full-coverage compact status index, loaded
 * asynchronously (AC-348, revising AC-335 (e)).
 *
 * AC-335's Quay leg read `snapshot.tasks.recent`, which the panel truncates to
 * `QUAY_RECENT_LIST_LIMIT` (10) rows: a transition on the eleventh-ranked task
 * was invisible, and the reading still claimed `complete`. AC-348 replaces that
 * source with a per-project COMPACT STATUS INDEX built from
 * `task list --json --no-body` — every task, no body — loaded NON-BLOCKING,
 * deduped and rate-limited inside the quay service, and reported per project in
 * a new `sources[]` field, so `cold` / `warming` / `bootstrap` / `stale` /
 * `ready` / `error` are legible instead of being flattened into "no change".
 *
 * This criterion drives the REAL modules twice over: `createQuayService` owns
 * the index, the loader and its budget, and it is composed into the REAL
 * `buildChanges` through the SAME three-member bag `server/index.ts` binds. The
 * loader the counters watch is the service's own `runCommand` dependency, so
 * "one load per project per minute" is a reading of the shipped rate limiter —
 * not of a test double that could be deduping on the implementation's behalf.
 *
 * Readings, one leg each:
 *   (a) FULL COVERAGE: with a 30-task project whose fifteenth-ranked task
 *       transitions, exactly one `quay_task` event appears — a reading taken
 *       from `recent` (the newest ten) could not have seen it — and the
 *       `sources` entry says `coverage: 'full'` / `taskCount: 30`;
 *   (b) BOOTSTRAP: a project the cursor has never seen emits NO event on its
 *       first full reading, reports `state: 'bootstrap'`, and records the
 *       baseline; only a task that appears AFTER that baseline becomes an
 *       `appeared` event (a cursor with no baseline must never turn a whole
 *       project into "everything is new");
 *   (c) FOUR INSTANTS: a transition carries `transition.from`/`to`, its `at` is
 *       the RECORD's own `updatedAt` (with `atSource: 'record.updatedAt'`), its
 *       `source.observedAt` is when the INDEX was loaded, and `ageMs` is the
 *       difference — so the same transition re-read later has the same `at` and
 *       `(kind, ref, at)` still dedupes;
 *   (d) NON-BLOCKING: with a loader that never resolves, `changes` returns well
 *       inside 50 ms, reports the index as `cold`/`warming` with a
 *       machine-readable gap and `complete: false`, and twenty concurrent and
 *       repeated calls inside one minute run the loader EXACTLY once per
 *       project — with zero whole-snapshot CLI runs;
 *   (e) STALE: an index past its freshness window keeps its data and still
 *       diffs (no event is lost, the reading is not "absent"), reports
 *       `state: 'stale'` with `observedAt`/`ageMs`, and `complete: false` — and
 *       the same index inside the window is `ready` and complete (the negative
 *       control that makes `stale` a reading rather than a constant);
 *   (f) RESTART / CLEARED INDEX: a cursor that carries a baseline while the
 *       server's index is empty invents NO event, reports the gap, keeps the
 *       baseline in the next cursor, and diffs against that baseline once the
 *       load lands — one real change, not "every task is new".
 *
 * The whitelist entry that makes the load legal at all (AC-348 (g)) is read in
 * `quay.service.test.ts`, beside the command table it belongs to.
