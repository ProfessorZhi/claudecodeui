/**
 * The error codes each MCP tool DECLARES it can return (AC-285): the ONE place
 * a tool's set of possible codes is written down.
 *
 * AC-285 requires the gateway's failure vocabulary to have a single source and
 * every tool to state which of its codes it can actually produce. This module is
 * the tool-side half: `MCP_ERROR_CODES` (in `mcp-error-envelope.ts`) is the
 * vocabulary, and {@link MCP_TOOL_ERROR_CODES} maps every gateway tool name to
 * the SUBSET of that vocabulary the tool can leave on the wire. The transport's
 * one `audited` seam attaches each row to its registration as `_meta`
 * (`{ 'cloudcli/errorCodes': [...] }`), so a real `tools/list` read-back carries
 * the declaration rather than a hand-kept list in a criterion.
 *
 * ## Why a total record over the tool-name union
 *
 * The record is typed `Record<McpGatewayToolName, readonly McpErrorCode[]>`, so a
 * tool added to any of the three tool tables without a row here fails to compile
 * rather than shipping with an empty declaration — the same guard
 * `mcp-tool-annotations.ts` uses. {@link readMcpToolErrorCodes} THROWS on an
 * unknown name for the same reason `readMcpToolAnnotations` does: the transport
 * calls it for every tool it registers, so a name with no row is a wiring bug
 * that must surface at mount time, not a silent omission on the wire.
 *
 * ## What each row means
 *
 * Every row starts from {@link WRAPPER_CODES} — the three codes the audited
 * wrapper itself can produce for ANY tool (a declared-input validation failure,
 * a scope denial, and the `INTERNAL_ERROR` fallback for a handler that throws
 * something unattributable). A tool that takes a `project` / `session` reference
 * adds the AC-246 target-gate codes for that kind; a tool whose handler has its
 * own refusals adds those. The codes a tool CANNOT produce are deliberately left
 * out, so the declaration is a reading of the tool rather than "all of them".
 *
 * Service codes forwarded unchanged from a dependency's own vocabulary (the
 * control service's `UNSUPPORTED_PROVIDER`, the resident host's
 * `LIFECYCLE_MODE_*`, the self-target guard's `SELF_TARGET`, …) are NOT listed
 * here: `mcp-error-envelope.ts` documents that a well-formed service code passes
 * through `McpErrorResult` untouched, and the declaration is about the codes the
 * GATEWAY decides for itself.
 *
 * Consumers: `mcp-gateway.transport.ts`'s `audited` helper (the single call site,
 * which attaches the row to every registration's `_meta`) and this module's
 * criterion, `tests/mcp-error-vocabulary.test.ts`, which reads the declaration
 * back off a real `tools/list` and checks every observed code against it.
