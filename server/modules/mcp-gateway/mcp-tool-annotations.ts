/**
 * The MCP gateway's tool annotations (AC1–AC7): the ONE place a
 * `tools/list` annotation is written down.
 *
 * MCP annotations are DECLARATIVE METADATA. They are not authorization: the
 * scopes on a tool's registration are the only thing that decides whether a call
 * runs. A host (ChatGPT's custom-MCP / developer mode, Claude Code, …) reads
 * these hints to decide whether to ask the user for per-call confirmation, and
 * the whole point of auditing them is to remove UNNECESSARY confirmations by
 * making the hints accurate — never by labelling a write as read-only or
 * non-destructive. A wrong `readOnlyHint: true` on a mutating tool would be a
 * correctness bug that silences a confirmation prompt, so the rules below lean
 * conservative on every hint whose meaning is "this can go wrong".
 *
 * ## The four hints, and the rule each is read by here
 *
 *  - `readOnlyHint` (spec default `false`): true only when the handler mutates
 *    no stored/domain state.
 *  - `destructiveHint` (spec default `true`, meaningful only when
 *    `readOnlyHint === false`): true when the call can discard or terminate
 *    work that already exists. An ambiguous write is marked destructive rather
 *    than non-destructive — over-labelling costs an extra confirmation, under-
 *    labelling is the bug this task exists to prevent.
 *  - `idempotentHint` (spec default `false`): true when a repeat of the call
 *    with the same arguments, against the same state, has no further effect.
 *    Set true only where that reading is pinned by the handler's own documented
 *    behaviour; otherwise left false (the spec default).
 *  - `openWorldHint` (spec default `true`): true when the tool's effect is
 *    delivered OUTSIDE this server's own store — it drives, starts, stops or
 *    authorizes a provider agent/process. False for tools confined to CloudCLI's
 *    stored state (its database, its lease table, its queue, its cached
 *    snapshot).
 *
 * ## AC1 — the audit table
 *
 * Every tool reachable on `tools/list`, its annotations before this task (there
 * were none — the gateway passed no `annotations` at all), and the annotations
 * declared now, with the handler fact each value rests on:
 *
 * | tool                  | before | readOnly | destructive | idempotent | openWorld | why |
 * |-----------------------|--------|----------|-------------|------------|-----------|-----|
 * | `overview`            | none   | true     | false       | true       | false     | reads the local overview + cached snapshot |
 * | `projects_list`       | none   | true     | false       | true       | false     | reads the project table |
 * | `sessions_list`       | none   | true     | false       | true       | false     | reads the session table |
 * | `session_get`         | none   | true     | false       | true       | false     | reads one session + its host snapshot |
 * | `session_read`        | none   | true     | false       | true       | false     | reads a transcript |
 * | `run_get`             | none   | true     | false       | true       | false     | reads the run registry; waiting does not mutate |
 * | `quay_snapshot`       | none   | true     | false       | true       | false     | reads the quay store; `refresh` only repopulates a derived cache |
 * | `ui_last_opened_session`| none | true     | false       | true       | false     | reads the browser's last-opened pointer; the write is the browser's own route |
 * | `ui_visible_context`  | none   | true     | false       | true       | false     | asks the browsers what they show; nothing stored, no state mutated |
 * | `ui_clients_list`     | none   | true     | false       | true       | false     | lists the connected browsers and their status; nothing stored, no state mutated |
 * | `session_search`      | none   | true     | false       | true       | false     | scans stored transcripts and titles; nothing stored, no state mutated |
 * | `session_send`        | none   | false    | false       | false      | true      | additive: queues/sends a message, starts a run; two sends are two turns |
 * | `session_create`      | none   | false    | false       | false      | true      | additive: mints a session (and may start its first run); two creates are two sessions |
 * | `session_interrupt`   | none   | false    | true        | false      | true      | terminates the run in flight; the work it held is lost |
 * | `session_start`       | none   | false    | false       | true       | true      | launches the resident host; "already running is a success" |
 * | `session_close`       | none   | false    | true        | false      | true      | terminates the resident host; its leases are gone and are not recovered |
 * | `ui_open_session`     | none   | false    | false       | true       | false     | asks ONE browser to open a session; discards nothing and drives no provider agent |
 * | `session_cancel_queued`| none  | false    | true        | true       | false     | withdraws a queued message irreversibly; a repeat finds it gone |
 * | `session_reconfigure` | none   | false    | false       | true       | false     | writes a stored preference; repeating the same value is a no-op |
 * | `session_background`  | none   | false    | true        | false      | true      | its `stopTaskId` branch stops a held task (the list branch alone is a read) |
 * | `approvals_list`      | none   | true     | false       | true       | false     | reads the pending-approval set |
 * | `approval_answer`     | none   | false    | false       | false      | true      | authorizes a pending agent action; a re-answer finds nothing pending |
 *
 * AC6 (metadata only, enforcement untouched) is discharged by the shape of the
 * change: the only edits are this table, the optional `annotations` field the
 * audit wrapper forwards to `registerTool`, and the one call site that reads a
 * name off this table. No scope, no `requiredScopes`, no principal check and no
 * handler body is touched — `withMcpAudit` still decides `denied`/`ok`/`error`
 * from `requiredScopes` alone.
 *
 * Consumers: `mcp-gateway.transport.ts` (whose one `audited` seam attaches
 * {@link readMcpToolAnnotations} to every registration) and this module's
 * criterion, which drives a real mount and compares `tools/list` against
 * {@link MCP_TOOL_ANNOTATIONS}.
