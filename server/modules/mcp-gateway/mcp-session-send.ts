/**
 * The MCP gateway's `session_send` handler (AC-249).
 *
 * `session_send` opens a chat run through the SAME control service the
 * WebSocket gateway and the scheduled-message timer use, and returns the run's
 * id IMMEDIATELY — the run keeps going after the tool call resolves. That
 * immediacy is structural, not a timeout: the wait loop lives only inside the
 * `waitSeconds > 0` branch (routed through AC-248's `buildRunGet`), so a
 * default-`waitSeconds` call has no `sleep` reachable from it at all.
 *
 * What this module owns is the ADAPTER half: the caller is the token's owner
 * (`{ userId, via: 'mcp' }`), the control service's structured refusals are
 * translated into {@link McpToolError}s the audit wrapper renders as the one
 * failure envelope (AC-284; the control service's `RUN_IN_PROGRESS` becomes the
 * gateway's `SESSION_BUSY`), and the two facts the control service cannot state — the run's
 * recorded `source` and, on `RUN_IN_PROGRESS`, the id of the run that is still
 * in flight — are read back from the run registry.
 *
 * Everything is injected ({@link McpSessionSendDeps}): the control seam, the run
 * reader, and the `run_get` builder plus its deps. Production wires the process
 * singletons (`server/index.ts`); the criterion wires the real control service
 * over its own fixture and the real `buildRunGet` over a fake clock. The module
 * holds no clock of its own — it never calls `Date.now()` or `setTimeout`, so
 * the bounded wait moves only through the injected `now`/`sleep` inside
 * `buildRunGet`.
 *
 * AC-272 adds the optional {@link McpSessionSendSelection}: when it is wired, an
 * options-less send reads the session's recorded model/effort/permissionMode and
 * puts them on the run, so a `session_reconfigure` a caller made is what the next
 * `session_send` actually runs with. Absent, the send is byte-identical to
 * AC-249's.
 *
 * gap-mcp-session-send-reports-pending-interaction-it-queued-behind adds the
 * optional {@link McpSessionSendApprovals}: a `queued: true` send names the
 * pending approval it was queued behind, read from the SAME pending set
 * `approvals_list` and `session_get` report (the runtime service's own lookup)
 * and projected through the ONE `toPendingInteraction` both of those tools use —
 * so a caller learns, in this single return, that a person is being waited on and
 * which tool to answer with, instead of reading a healthy park as a stall.
 *
 * AC-337 adds the optional opaque `correlationId` label, which S3 (SPEC §6.1)
 * moves from the run onto the DELIVERY. It is not sent to the control service and
 * it changes nothing about how a run is dispatched: when the caller supplied a
 * usable one, it is stamped onto the delivery this adapter was just handed
 * ({@link McpRunReader.setDeliveryCorrelationId}, addressed by delivery id —
 * falling back to the run-addressed write when the delivery id is unknown), and
 * it rides the call's audit row through the wrapper's own reading of the
 * argument. With no label the send is byte-for-byte what it was — no registry
 * write, no extra argument.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ADAPTER DOES AND DOES NOT REJECT. This tool never refuses a send on
 * its OWN account: it only queues, it never auto-answers, and a `queued: false`
 * send is never blocked. A send that reached here has already been decided on —
 * the control service either opened a run or refused one (`SESSION_BUSY`), and
 * this adapter only translates. The BOUND on how MUCH text may be waiting (a
 * UTF-8 byte budget, not a message count) is NOT here: it belongs to the caller
 * that can see a backlog building, and the Live Voice relay enforces one before
 * it ever calls this adapter (`voice-realtime-ws-proxy.service.ts`,
 * `VOICE_QUEUE_MAX_BYTES` / `VOICE_QUEUE_FULL`). An MCP client calling
 * `session_send` directly is bounded only by the session's own queue, exactly as
 * before — this adapter's semantics are unchanged.
