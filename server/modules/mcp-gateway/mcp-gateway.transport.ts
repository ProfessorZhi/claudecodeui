/**
 * The MCP gateway's production assembly (AC-240). The consumer is
 * `server/index.ts`, which mounts it BEFORE the static-assets middleware.
 *
 * `/mcp` is a STATELESS Streamable HTTP endpoint: every POST builds its own
 * `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` with no session generator and its own
 * `McpServer`, connects them, and hands the request to the transport. Two
 * consecutive requests from one client are therefore two independent exchanges,
 * neither carrying an `Mcp-Session-Id`. `GET`/`DELETE` answer 405 in JSON-RPC,
 * following the SDK's stateless recipe.
 *
 * Mount ORDER is load-bearing, not cosmetic: mounted after the static layer the
 * SPA catch-all would answer `/mcp` with `200 text/html` and no MCP client would
 * ever reach the transport — which is why the mount call sits before
 * `createStaticAssetsMiddleware` and a criterion scans for that order.
 *
 * The gate decides AT MOUNT TIME. When `MCP_ENABLED` is not truthy nothing is
 * attached — no `app.post`/`app.get`/`app.delete` layer exists at the path — so
 * the path is ABSENT rather than forbidden. `authorize` is a seam: the default
 * refuses every request (fail-closed 401), while supplying `tokens` (and, once
 * OAuth is on, `oauth`) lets this mount build the real AC-241/AC-263 auth
 * middleware in front of the transport.

/**
 * A fresh server per request, the stateless recipe's other half.
 *
 * Which tools it carries is decided here, once per request:
 *
 *  1. an explicit `registerTools` seam wins — the criterion-injected path
 *     AC-244's audit criterion uses to install scripted tools;
 *  2. otherwise, when production deps were supplied, AC-245's read tools are
 *     registered through the SAME audited wrapper (a seam closing over this
 *     request's server and principal), so each read tool inherits its audit row
 *     and its `cloudcli:read` refusal without restating either;
 *  3. otherwise an empty list handler is installed, because the server still has
 *     to answer `tools/list` with a result rather than "method not found"
 *     (AC-240's tools-less mount).
 *
 * The three paths are exclusive: a registered tool installs the SDK's own
 * list/call handlers, which would collide with a second, manual `tools/list`.
 *
 * AC-246's target gate sits INSIDE the audited wrapper and OUTSIDE the tool
 * body (path 2): a `project` / `session` argument is resolved to an id before
 * the read tool's handler runs, and an unresolvable target refuses the call
 * there. The gate is applied only when {@link McpGatewayDeps.resolveDeps} was
 * supplied — an unwired mount keeps AC-240/244/245's exact behaviour, and the
 * write tools AC-249 registers compose the same `resolveInputTargets` wrapper.
 *
 * Stage-4 write tools (AC-249, extended by AC-250 and AC-251) register through
 * the same seam when {@link McpGatewayDeps.writeTools} is present, so their audit
 * row, scope refusal and target gate are the identical machinery — only the name
 * set and the handlers differ. The write-tools bag flows through unchanged, so
 * AC-250's `sessionCreate` / `sessionInterrupt` members and AC-251's
 * `sessionHostControl` member reach `registerMcpWriteTools` and swap in the real
 * `session_create` / `session_interrupt` / `session_start` / `session_close`
 * handlers; a bag without them keeps the placeholders. An unwired mount registers
 * neither read nor write tools and keeps answering an empty `tools/list`.
 *
 * Stage-6 resident tools (AC-271) register through that same seam when
 * {@link McpGatewayDeps.residentTools} is present. They are a SEPARATE table
 * from the stage-4 write tools — `session_cancel_queued` is not one of the five
 * — so the stage-4 name set AC-249 pins stays exactly five, and the resident
 * bag flows to `registerMcpResidentTools` over the same one control service.
 * The bag's optional members register their own tools alongside the table, gated
 * on being supplied: AC-272's `reconfigure`, AC-273's `background`, and AC-274's
 * `approvals` (`approvals_list` / `approval_answer`). AC-271's criterion pins the
 * table's observable contents, so those tools are registered by
 * `registerMcpResidentTools`, never by growing {@link MCP_STAGE6_RESIDENT_TOOLS}.

 * composition root can supply — above all the one {@link McpGatewayModuleDeps.control}
 * instance — and fills the rest of {@link McpGatewayDeps} from the owning
 * modules' barrels, so `server/index.ts` reads as "one control service, handed
 * to every front end" rather than as a bag of imports.
 *
 * It RETURNS a deps object rather than mounting, because AC-240's frozen
 * criterion requires `server/index.ts` to contain the `mountMcpGateway(...)`
 * call it scans for. The production line is therefore
 * `mountMcpGateway(app, createMcpGatewayModule({ control: chatControl, ... }))`:
 * `mountMcpGateway` keeps its name and semantics, and the same `chatControl`
 * identifier appears in the `createMcpGatewayModule` argument — the reading
 * AC-253(a) takes.
 *
 * Consumers: `server/index.ts`. A criterion that wants the SOURCE-level wiring
 * reads this function's name off `server/index.ts`; a criterion that wants the
 * runtime behaviour supplies the same assembled deps to `mountMcpGateway`.
