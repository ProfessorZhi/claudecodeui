/**
 * MCP tool-call auditing (AC-244).
 *
 * Every tool invocation writes EXACTLY one row to `mcp_audit_log`, whatever its
 * result: `ok`, `denied` (the token lacks a required scope, so the handler never
 * runs) or `error` (the handler threw). The arguments are reduced to a digest
 * before they reach the database — session and project ids are kept verbatim,
 * every other string is replaced by its length and first 40 characters — so the
 * full text of a tool call can never be read back out of the log. AC-286: a
 * `denied` row also carries the scopes the caller was MISSING
 * (`denied_scopes`), whether the refusal came from the generic check here or
 * from a handler's own scope check throwing {@link McpScopeDeniedError}.
 *
 * The retention sweep and the audit dispatch are both injectable: the clock and
 * the interval scheduler are seams, so a criterion can plant an old row or
 * capture the daily callback without waiting on wall time. The module holds no
 * module-level timer or cache, so an injected seam is never shadowed by state
 * left over from another mount.
 *
 * Consumers: `mcp-gateway.transport.ts` registers tools through
 * {@link withMcpAudit} and starts retention at mount time; this module's
 * criterion drives every export directly.

 * both are forwarded to `registerTool` verbatim and appear on `tools/list`, but
 * they are metadata only — the `denied`/`ok`/`error` decision below is made from
 * `requiredScopes` alone, so a declaration can never widen or narrow what a
 * token may call.
 *
 * An optional second argument threads AC-303's write-notification seam. It is
 * called ONLY from the `ok` branch, AFTER the audit row is written, and is wrapped
 * in its own try/catch: a throwing notifier must not change the tool call's
 * result nor turn the `ok` row into an `error` one. The seam is handed every
 * registration (read and write alike) and classifies each call itself — a

 * declared schema with the SDK so `tools/list` advertises it (AC-288 (f)), and
 * the SDK's handler would then reject a bad argument with its own text-only
 * `Input validation error: …` before the audited runner ever ran — exactly the
 * residue AC-288 removes. Replacing the handler makes the runner's
 * `INVALID_ARGUMENT` envelope the only validation outcome, and lets an
 * unregistered name answer `UNKNOWN_TOOL` instead of the SDK's `Tool X not
 * found` sentence.
 *
 * A registered name runs through its audited runner — the SAME function the SDK
 * handler used to invoke, so the audit row, the scope refusal, the
 * declared-schema validation and the success rendering are unchanged. An
 * unregistered name returns {@link unknownToolResult} and writes NO audit row:
 * it is not a call to any tool, so there is no tool call to record.
 *
 * A server with no audited tool (AC-240's tools-less mount, or a seam that
 * registers nothing) is left untouched, so `tools/call` keeps whatever the mount
 * installed.
 *
 * Consumers: `mcp-gateway.transport.ts`'s `createMcpServer`, once per request,
 * after the injected / read / write / resident tools are all installed.
