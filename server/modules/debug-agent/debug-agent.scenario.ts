 * content rather than a second message. `wait` and `scroll` change nothing on
 * disk: they exist so a scenario can express the passage of time and a
 * follow-along intent without inventing a frame to carry them.
 *
 * The host steps are the same kind of statement about a different seam.
 * `unattended-turn` opens a run for the session with no client behind it and
 * delivers the turn through the host — the row it writes is the turn's own user
 * row, so the step changes the transcript as well, and the trigger it carries is
 * what the row's `origin` says the turn was for. `keepalive-add` and
 * `keepalive-remove` report a reason the process is held open besides a turn,
 * `identity` reports the address the process answers to, and `exit` reports that
 * the process went away. None of them names a frame or an event: they are
 * statements about a process and a transcript, which is the whole of what this
 * document is allowed to describe.
 *
 * `turn-end` is the counterpart of the turn `unattended-turn` opens, and it is a
 * step of its own rather than something the next turn implies: a process that has
 * finished a turn and is still held open is the 空闲 state, and a scenario that
 * could not say "this turn ended" could never place that state on the clock. It
 * writes nothing and carries nothing, because it states an end rather than a
 * row — the same reason `wait` is a step.
 *
 * `dequeue` and `cancel-ack` are the same shape of step for the CLI's own queue
 * (`docs/proposals/claude-resident-sessions-experiments.md` §9.2): the first says
 * the process took the oldest command it is holding and started it, the second
 * that it acted on a withdrawal and dropped a command it had never started. Both
 * carry nothing, because what they state is a moment on the clock for a queue
 * whose commands the run was told about when they were pushed — the scenario
 * cannot know a uuid the host minted at push time, which is exactly why the
 * engine reads the queue rather than the document for these two.
