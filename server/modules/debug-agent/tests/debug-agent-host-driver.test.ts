/**
 * The criterion for AC-160: the debug agent's host driver face, and the
 * unattended turn that only it can produce.
 *
 * What is pinned here is a chain, not a single call: a provider that declares
 * `multiplexedHost` gets several resident sessions on one process (AC3); a turn
 * nobody asked for is opened BY THE HOST LAYER and its frames reach the run the
 * host layer opened, through the product's own normalizer, with no browser
 * connected (AC4); the reasons a process is held (leases) and the reason it is
 * gone (`exited`/`oom`, `aborted`) are the manager's own record (AC5); detaching
 * one of two sessions on a multiplexed process leaves the other byte-identical
 * and does not kill the process (AC6); and a closed gate means no debug host
 * exists at all (AC7).
 *
 * The two readings that make AC4 discriminating are `run.source` and the run's
 * `seq`/`lastSeq`: both are decided by WHO OPENED THE RUN. An engine that built
 * its own frame and opened its own run would still deliver frames to a client —
 * and would still read plausibly on four of the six lines below — while
 * answering `scheduled` here and getting the frame accounting wrong. That is the
 * false form AC8 measures, and the reason those readings are printed before they
 * are asserted.
 *
 * Why the AC4 arm drives `provider.runtime.run` directly instead of the
 * application's `providerRuntimeService.run`: that dispatcher routes every run
 * through `sessionHostManager.trackPerRunTurn`, which (a) supersedes the host a
 * session is already bound to — destroying the resident, multiplexed binding
 * this arm exists to measure — and (b) hands the runtime the *default* per-run
 * wrapper, which knows no driver, so a host step would have no host to open a
 * turn on. The arm therefore binds the session resident through the manager
 * itself and hands the runtime the same `ProviderRuntimeContext` a dispatcher
 * would hand it, with the provider's own `normalizeMessage`. The context members
 * the debug runtime never reads are stubbed with trivially-true answers, each
 * named below; that the runtime needs none of them is a fact about this
 * provider, not a claim by this file.
 *
 * Why every reading comes from a CHILD process: the gate is evaluated once per
 * process and cached, a run opens the process's database, and the fixture home
 * is a per-run scratch directory — so one child per arm is the only way to take
 * a reading with the previous arm's state out of it. The six arms are
 * independent (own scratch home, own database file, own manager) and run three
 * at a time so this criterion stays off the fleet's shared CPU budget.
 *
 * Read by the goal driver when it re-runs AC-160, and by the worker that
 * recorded the completion note that quotes these lines.
 *
 * What is NOT here, on purpose: the sibling criteria this task must not break
 * (AC-123/AC-126/AC-136) and `npm run typecheck` / `npm run lint` are measured
 * by the worker and recorded, not spawned from here. Each of them costs seconds
 * (the external-write criterion alone ~29s), and re-running them inside a
 * criterion that has a hard 60s wall-clock ceiling would make this file's exit
 * code a statement about the host's load rather than about the debug agent.
 * What IS here is every cheap, environment-independent reading of the same
 * claims: the union line verbatim, the delta file set, and a content hash per
 * sibling criterion file.
