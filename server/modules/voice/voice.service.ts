 * which branch happened to produce the failure, and the set of statuses this path could answer was
 * not readable from anywhere. Every code in the vocabulary now has exactly one row, and each is
 * reachable from the proxy path: the adapters translate a transport-level failure into a code, and
 * this table is the only place a code becomes HTTP.
 *
 * WHY THESE NUMBERS, stated once instead of per site:
 *   · 503 / 400 — no backend is configured, or the configured URL could never be called. The
 *     distinction is whose value was wrong: the deployment's own environment (503, not the
 *     caller's to fix) against a URL that arrived in the request (400).
 *   · 502 — the upstream refused the credential, or answered something unreadable. Neither is
 *     fixable from here, and 502 is what this path has always answered a rejected key with.
 *   · 429 — the upstream's own rate limit, reported as itself: it is the one upstream status whose
 *     meaning a client changes behaviour on, and folding it into 502 would hide that.
 *   · 504 / 413 / 415 / 422 — timed out, too large, wrong container, no speech. Four different user
 *     remedies, four numbers; the two upload ones are also the codes the result itself republishes.
 *
 * WHAT IT DECIDES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. It decides the STATUS of every failure this path returns.
 * Whether a failure also republishes its code in the result body is a separate question, and its
 * answer is now the wide one: EVERY failure that reaches this table was named in the vocabulary by
 * someone — a gate in this module, or the adapter that read the transport — so the code travels
 * with all of them rather than with the pre-upstream three alone. That is a change and not a
 * restatement: a failure read off the transport used to be answered message-only, on the reading
 * that its remedy was not a client's to choose between. The reading was wrong for the same reason
 * the vocabulary exists at all: `422` and `502` are each several different remedies, and a client
 * asked to write the sentence a user reads cannot pick between them from a number.
 *
 * WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT DO is name a code for a refusal that never becomes an attempt. The format
 * gate and an unregistered provider id are refused before any adapter is asked anything, and
 * neither has a vocabulary member to be named by — `VoiceServiceResult.code` states that scope once,
 * for the readers of the wire.

 * The endpoint rule: the refusal owed a `'proxy-only'` provider whose configured address its own

 *
 * WHY THIS IS A PROVIDER RULE AND NOT A TABLE HERE. What counts as a service's address is a fact
 * about the service — its hostname shapes, the transport it speaks — and this module has no way to
 * keep a second copy of it in step with the provider that owns it. The rule therefore travels on
 * the adapter (`AsrAdapter.allowedBaseUrl`, which the registry hands out as the module's own
 * export), and this function only decides WHEN it is asked: exactly for the providers that declare
 * `transport: 'proxy-only'`.
 *
 * WHY ONLY THOSE, and this is the half a reader will otherwise read as an oversight. A `'direct'`
 * provider's address is the user's own OpenAI-compatible backend, and http and private hosts are
 * deliberately legal there (`validateBackendBaseUrl` says so in as many words — a local backend is
 * a supported deployment). Holding every provider to this service's hostname shape would refuse
 * exactly those deployments, so the rule's scope is the transport declaration: a provider a browser
 * cannot reach is one whose address this server, and only this server, will speak to, and that is
 * the provider whose address has to be the service's own.
 *
 * THE REFUSAL IS PRE-REQUEST, which is the property the code and the status rest on: it is decided
 * from the resolved configuration and the adapter's declaration alone, so it costs no `fetchBackend`
 * call. The status is the table's `INVALID_BASE_URL` row rather than a literal here, and — unlike
 * the two gates above it — the code IS republished, because the caller acts on it differently from
 * a generic 400: "the address you configured is not one this recogniser may be reached at" is a
 * remedy ("use the address the service gave you"), while a 400 with no code could be anything.
 *
 * An adapter that declares `'proxy-only'` and carries no rule is not refused here: this function
 * has nothing to ask, and inventing a rule would be the second source of truth it exists not to be.
 * What catches that pairing is the seam's own criterion, which reads the registry rather than this
 * call site.
 *
 * AN ABSENT ADDRESS IS NOT THIS FUNCTION'S QUESTION, and the guard below says so rather than
 * leaving it to call order. "No backend configured" is a property of the settings (503, and the
 * user's own to fix), while "this address is not this service's" is a property of what they typed;
 * a rule asked about the empty string would answer "no" and report the second failure for the
 * first condition. It is asked about a value, or not at all.
 *
 * Exported so the probe can drive the same gate the service runs, and so a reader of the service
 * can see the rule's scope stated once.

        // WHAT IT IS GUARDING AGAINST, stated as the two roads that reach it. First, the LOG PORT:
        // `recordAttempt` prints the row through the same port this line went out on, and a port that
        // refuses the row would otherwise throw straight into the `catch (error)` that closes this
        // whole attempt — the one below at the end of `transcribe`, whose only vocabulary is
        // `unreachableBackendFailure(...)`, so a transcription that SUCCEEDED would be answered as a
        // 502 whose text says the backend was unreachable. That is the failure mode this task exists
        // to remove, and it is not hypothetical: `logAttempt('ok', 200, …)` sits inside that `try`,
        // so the throw would be folded into a refusal with the transcription already in hand.
        // Second, the CAPTURE PORT itself: it is an injected seam, and a deployment's own port may
        // throw where this module's answers — the reason the guard wraps the CALL rather than a
        // particular line inside the capture module.
        //
        // WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT COVER. `log.info` for the attempt line above is outside it,
        // and has to be: that line is this path's own record of the attempt, it is written in every
        // mode, and swallowing a port that refuses IT would silently drop the one line the operator
        // reads the attempt by. The line is not the recorder's, so the recorder's guard is not over
        // it. What the guard covers is exactly the recording, and what it produces on the way out is
