/**
 * D1's user-data store: the local-only recordings, default ON.
 *
 * THE READINGS ARE TAKEN ON REAL BYTES ON A REAL DIRECTORY. Every case drives the SHIPPING service
 * (`createVoiceService`) with the SHIPPING store (`createVoiceDataStore`) pointed at a throwaway
 * directory, so "a transcription wrote a record" is a fact about the filesystem rather than about a
 * private function: the record's own JSON is read back, the audio file beside it is stat'ed, and the
 * modes are read off the files themselves. The store is a separate module from the diagnostic
 * capture (`voice-capture.ts`), and nothing here sets `VOICE_CAPTURE` — that the two coexist without
 * changing each other is the isolation criterion's reading, which lives with the capture tests.
 *
 * THE SERVICE IS DRIVEN DIRECTLY rather than through the router for the write cases, and the ONE
 * route reading (the `DELETE`) goes through a real express app so "the route answers with a count"
 * is a real HTTP answer. `voice.capture` is never wired, so a case that accidentally depended on the
 * diagnostic seam would fail rather than pass quietly.
 *
 * THE CONFIDENCE AXIS NEEDS AN ADAPTER NOBODY SHIPPED. Every recogniser in the registry declares
 * `tokens.confidence: false`, so "a declaring recogniser writes `flagStats`" is unreachable through
 * the shipping declarations alone — the criterion would pass on a registry that could never produce
 * the reading it claims to test. The last case therefore registers a stand-in that declares the
 * capability and answers tokens carrying confidence, drives the SHIPPING service through it, and
 * removes it again; the paired undeclared reading is the shipping openai-compatible recogniser,
 * whose declaration is the reason its record has no `flagStats` at all.
