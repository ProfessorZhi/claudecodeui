/**
 * AC-149's criterion: an upstream failure is classified by the error CODE its answer carries, with the
 * status as the fallback, into the stable vocabulary — and the code→HTTP table has exactly one row per
 * member, no more and no fewer.
 *
 * WHAT IS BEING READ, AND WHY IT NEEDS A READING AT ALL. Each adapter used to own a three-line
 * `errorCodeForStatus(status)`: `401|403 → UNAUTHORIZED`, `429 → RATE_LIMITED`, everything else
 * `UPSTREAM_ERROR`. A mapper that reads only the number cannot tell apart three different facts a
 * `403` carries — a refused credential, a model the account has not enabled, an account in arrears —
 * and the sentence the user needs differs for each. So the reading here is not "a status maps to a
 * code" (that was already true); it is "the ANSWER BODY decides, the status is the fallback, and one
 * (status, body) pair reads the same way through the pure classifier and through the shipped
 * adapter". Two rows below share a status and differ in their code string, which is the reading that
 * separates body-first from status-only.
 *
 * HOW THE READINGS ARE TAKEN. Nothing here reaches a network, a socket or a process. The pure
 * classifier is called directly; the shipped `dashscope-omni` adapter is driven through an OFFLINE
 * STAND-IN TRANSPORT injected on `AsrInvocation.fetchImpl`, which answers with the very body the row
 * names — so the code the adapter reports is a reading of those bytes and not of the process around
 * it. The status table is read twice and the two readings are required to agree: as the runtime object
 * imported from `voice.service.ts`, and as the source text that object is written as. The second
 * reading is what a falsifying form can move (see
 * `voice-error-classification.false-forms.test.ts`).
 *
 * THE IMPORT SHAPE IS LOAD-BEARING. Every adapter value-imports `baseMimeType`/`declaredAcceptsMime`
 * from the registry, so the registry and its adapters form a value-edge cycle: entering an adapter
 * first evaluates the registry while the adapter it is reading is still in progress, which is
 * `ReferenceError: Cannot access '<id>' before initialization`. The registry is therefore imported
 * before the adapter, and the adapter is entered with `await import(...)` — the shape
 * `voice-provider-dispatch.test.ts` records.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO, AND WHERE THAT HALF LIVES. AC7 asks for the exit code of a list of
 * existing criteria plus `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint`; AC8's drift evidence is a compiler
 * run. Those are SUBPROCESSES, and AC1 requires this file to start none within a 15-second budget —
 * one `npm run typecheck` alone measures ~11 s here. Both halves live in
 * `voice-error-classification.false-forms.test.ts`, this task's other executable artifact and the file
 * AC1's budget is not about; both files' headers say which half they carry, and AC8's reading below
 * says out loud which part of it is not measured here.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx --tsconfig server/tsconfig.json --test server/modules/voice/tests/voice-error-classification.test.ts
