/**
 * The falsifying forms behind `voice-capture-audio.test.ts`, plus the exit-code half of AC8.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE FILE RATHER THAN MORE READINGS. A green criterion is evidence only if a broken
 * implementation would have made it red, and that claim is not something a passing run can show about
 * itself. So each case here builds a BROKEN copy of the capture module by a text mutation, runs the
 * whole reading list against it, and requires the readings it predicts to fail — by name, and with
 * the FIGURE that went wrong, so the red is attributable to a clause rather than to a reading. The
 * four mutations are the cheap ways to satisfy this task's words while missing its subject:
 *
 *   · (i) `write-in-text-too` — drop the mode from the write guard, so every deployment that records
 *     a row also writes a file. Every word about "the upload is written to a file" is still
 *     implemented, and the mode that must write NOTHING writes. If this case passes, AC6's
 *     `text.dirCreated`/`text.writeCalls` are not measuring the gate.
 *   · (ii-a) `bytes-truncated` — write the first half of the upload. A file is still created, at the
 *     resolved path, with the promised permissions, and its digest is a real sha256 of real bytes.
 *     If this case passes, AC3's `lenEqual`/`bytesEqual`/`shaMatch` are not measuring the bytes.
 *   · (ii-b) `bytes-base64-text` — write the base64 TEXT of the upload rather than the upload. This
 *     is the encode-conversion road: a deployment that "stores the audio" as a text field would pass
 *     every existence and permission reading and fail this one.
 *   · (iii) `no-permission-setting` — create the directory and the file with no permission argument
 *     and no `chmod`. See THE FORM THIS TASK NAMES THAT IS NOT REACHABLE below for why this is the
 *     reachable mutation and not the `mode:`-only one the AC names.
 *
 * EACH CASE HAS THREE PARTS, and the first is what keeps the other two from being vacuous:
 *   1. the UNMUTATED copy must clear the whole list (a harness that is red for its own reasons proves
 *      nothing by going red on a mutant);
 *   2. the MUTATED copy must red every reading the case predicts, and that reading's measured value
 *      must contain the figure the mutation changes — a reading that is red for some other reason, or
 *      green while the figure is visibly wrong, is reported as a hole rather than as a success;
 *   3. some reading OUTSIDE that family must still be green, so "the whole rig broke" is not what the
 *      red means.
 *
 * WHERE THE COPIES GO, AND WHY NOT BESIDE THIS FILE. A copy of a module keeps that module's relative
 * imports (`../../../shared/asr/…`), so a copy in this file's directory would not resolve them; the
 * copies therefore live beside the module they copy, under `server/modules/voice/`, which is the same
 * tree and the only place a copy resolves at all. Each copy gets its OWN path, because ESM caches a
 * module by URL: a mutant written over the base copy's path would import the already-evaluated base
 * module and the run would measure nothing. The criterion IMPORTS the capture module by path and
 * hands the resulting port and write-audio factory to the shipping service, so the mutation is the
 * only difference between the two arms of a case.
 *
 * THE FORM THIS TASK NAMES THAT IS NOT REACHABLE, and what stands in for it.
 *
 * The AC asks for a case named `mode-only-no-chmod`: delete the explicit `chmod` and keep the `mode:`
 * argument to `open`, and it must red AC4's `dirMode`/`fileMode` under `umask 0o000`. IT CANNOT, and
 * not because of anything this module does: `mode:` is an argument to `open(2)`/`mkdir(2)` and the
 * kernel applies `mode & ~umask` to it, so a umask can only ever CLEAR bits from the requested mode.
 * `0o700 & ~umask` is a subset of `0o700` for every umask, and it is exactly `0o700` at the umask
 * this criterion runs under — which is the umask chosen precisely so that nothing is masked. A
 * `mode:`-only implementation and a `mode:`-plus-`chmod` implementation therefore read IDENTICALLY
 * at `umask 0o000`, and the case the AC describes would pass while measuring the opposite of what it
 * claims. There is no umask that separates them, so this is a property of the reading rather than a
 * fixture that could be built better.
 *
 * What the reading DOES separate is "sets the permission bits this deployment promises" from "sets
 * none", which is a real and reachable implementation: with no `mode:` argument and no `chmod`, the
 * directory lands at `0777` and the file at `0666` under `umask 0o000`. That is the mutation below.
 * The `chmod` this task ships is therefore justified by the API's contract and by the AC's own words
 * rather than by this case — registered here so a reader does not take the case as evidence for a
 * separation it cannot make.
 *
 * THE OTHER NAMED FORM THAT IS A NO-OP, registered for the same reason. The AC offers
 * `Buffer.from(bytes.toString('base64'), 'base64')` as one of the re-encodings AC3 must catch. For
 * EVERY byte string that expression is the IDENTITY — base64 decoding is the exact inverse of base64
 * encoding, padding included — so as a mutation it changes no byte of the file and cannot red
 * anything. `bytes-base64-text` above is the reachable form of the same idea (the encode happens,
 * nothing decodes it back), and `bytes-truncated` is the other road the AC names.
 *
 * WHY AC8'S EXIT CODES ARE HERE. AC8 asks for the exit code of seven existing criteria plus
 * `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint`, each printed rather than assumed. Those are SUBPROCESSES,
 * and AC1 requires the criterion file itself to start none inside a fifteen-second budget — one
 * `npm run typecheck` alone is most of that budget. This file is the task's other executable artifact,
 * it already starts `git`, and it is not the file AC1's budget is about.
