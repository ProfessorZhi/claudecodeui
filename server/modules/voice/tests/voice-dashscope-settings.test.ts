/**
 * The user's own DashScope credential, from the settings document to the wire — and back.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. A recogniser whose transport is `proxy-only` cannot be reached by the
 * browser, so its address and key have to live on the server and the server has to present them
 * upstream. That makes three questions answerable only here:
 *
 *   1. WHICH provider is configured — asked per provider, not once for the whole link, because a
 *      provider reached with the USER's pair is not configured by the deployment's backend at all;
 *   2. WHERE the credential may appear — in the stored document and on the outbound request, never
 *      in a readback and never in a log line;
 *   3. WHICH credential each path uses — the transcription path must present the user's pair while
 *      TTS keeps presenting the deployment's, unchanged.
 *
 * The readings below are the measurements of those three, taken through the SHIPPING service, the
 * SHIPPING router and a real SQLite file in a temp directory. The upstream is an injected stub and
 * the log port is an injected collector, so nothing here touches the network or a real account
 * (ADR-004 decision 8: the live smoke is a human step).
 *
 * HOW IT IS STRUCTURED, and why this matters to a reader of the red: the readings live in one
 * exported function so that the FALSIFYING file (`voice-dashscope-settings.false-forms.test.ts`) can
 * run this very list against a text-mutated copy of `voice.service.ts` and require the specific
 * readings it predicts to go red. Registering them as `node:test` cases is guarded by `IS_ENTRY`,
 * so importing this file registers nothing and the falsify run measures only what it asked for.
 *
 * THE ENVIRONMENT IS CLEARED BEFORE ANY SHIPPED MODULE IS IMPORTED, in the module body rather than
 * in a hook, because a hook runs after the imports it would be protecting against: AC2's whole
 * subject is the link a deployment with no voice environment and no user document has, so the
 * variables have to be gone before `voice.module.ts`'s own defaults could be read from them. Every
 * shipped module below is therefore imported dynamically, after the loop.

   * AC4(b): the scan neither counts a neighbour's in-flight copy nor loses a real hit because of it.

   * THE FAULT THIS HOLDS SHUT, in the shape it was measured: `collectSourceFiles` traverses the
   * directory and then the loop `readFile`s what it collected. A sibling criterion writing and
   * deleting `__criterion-falsify-*.ts` in that same directory, at four-file concurrency, can be
   * deleted between those two syscalls — and the `ENOENT` that follows reaches `collectReadings` as
   * `ok=false` with the exception's message, which in shape is exactly what a real hit looks like.
   * This case makes that window fire on purpose, twenty times at twenty different offsets, and the
   * scan has to be unmoved by all of them.
   *
   * TWO ASSERTIONS, NOT ONE, because there are two ways to make the scan stable and only one of them
   * is correct: dropping every non-test file would also be "stable". So the churn is followed by a
   * POSITIVE CONTROL — a prefix-less file that really does contain the provider id — which must turn
   * the very same reading red with `shipping-hits=1` and name it. Stability plus a live positive
   * control is the whole claim.
