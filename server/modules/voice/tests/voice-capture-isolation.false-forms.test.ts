/**
 * The falsifying forms behind `voice-capture-isolation.test.ts`, plus the exit-code half of AC8.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE FILE RATHER THAN MORE READINGS. A green criterion is evidence only if a broken
 * implementation would have made it red, and that claim is not something a passing run can show about
 * itself. So each case here builds a BROKEN copy of the service module by a text mutation, runs the
 * whole reading list against it, and requires the readings it predicts to fail — by name, and with
 * the FIGURE that went wrong, so the red is attributable to a clause rather than to a reading. The
 * two mutations are the two cheap ways to satisfy this task's words while missing its subject:
 *
 *   · (i) `capture-throw-reaches-the-outer-catch` — delete the local guard around the recording call,
 *     so the throw from a port that refuses the row line escapes into the `catch (error)` that closes
 *     the whole attempt (`voice.service.ts`, the `unreachableBackendFailure` fold). Every sentence
 *     about "the recording failure is isolated" is still implemented — the capture module still builds
 *     the row, still writes the audio, and is byte-for-byte the shipping one — and a successful
 *     transcription is answered as a 502 whose text says the backend was unreachable, because the
 *     local guard is the ONLY thing between the recorder's failure and that fold. If this case passes,
 *     AC2's `text.resultIdentical` is not measuring the guard.
 *   · (ii) `failed-line-carries-the-transcript` — print the attempt's returned text on the failure
 *     line. The line still exists, still starts with the same words, and still appears exactly once;
 *     what it no longer is, is content-free. If this case passes, AC4's `failedLineContentFree` is not
 *     measuring the line.
 *
 * EACH CASE HAS THREE PARTS, and the first is what keeps the other two from being vacuous:
 *   1. the UNMUTATED copy must clear the whole list (a harness that is red for its own reasons proves
 *      nothing by going red on a mutant);
 *   2. the MUTATED copy must red every reading the case predicts, and that reading's measured value
 *      must contain the figure the mutation changes — a reading that is red for some other reason, or
 *      green while the figure is visibly wrong, is reported as a hole rather than as a success;
 *   3. some reading OUTSIDE that family must still be green, so "the whole rig broke" is not what the
 *      red means.
 *
 * WHERE THE COPIES GO, AND WHY NOT IN THIS FILE'S DIRECTORY. AC9 asks for the copies in the same
 * directory as the criterion, so that relative imports still resolve — and that REASON is exactly why
 * they cannot go there. Both mutations are in `voice.service.ts`, whose own imports are relative
 * (`./voice-capture.js`, `../../../shared/asr/asrRegistry.js`); a copy under `tests/` would resolve
 * the first to `tests/voice-capture.js` and the second to `server/shared/asr/…`, neither of which
 * exists. The copies therefore live beside the module they copy, under `server/modules/voice/` — the
 * same tree, and the only directory in which a copy of this module imports at all. Registered here
 * and in the criterion's AC10 rather than silently diverging.
 *
 * THE TWO CASES ARE TWO EDITS AND ONE PATH, because both mutations are in the same module. Each copy
 * gets its OWN path, because ESM caches a module by URL: a mutant written over the base copy's path
 * would import the already-evaluated base module and the run would measure nothing. `collectReadings`
 * takes the service module path as its one slot and the capture module is the shipping one in every
 * arm, so the mutation is the only difference between the two arms of a case.
 *
 * THE AC2 CLAUSE THIS FILE READS STRUCTURALLY RATHER THAN LITERALLY, registered so a reader does not
 * take the criterion for something it is not. AC2 asks for a port that throws on lines "以
 * `voice.capture {` 开头", which is the proposal's notation for a capture row. The SHIPPED row is
 * `{"event":"voice.capture",…}` — a fact AC-143/144/145 pin by parsing it — so a port keyed on that
 * literal prefix would never fire, and AC2's own `captureThrew≥1` would be unsatisfiable. The
 * criterion's port therefore refuses the line that IS a capture row (`parseCaptureRow`), which is the
 * same set read structurally and a superset of both spellings; AC7's port adds the literal prefix on
 * top, which is what makes AC7's arm strictly harder than AC2's.
 *
 * WHY AC8'S EXIT CODES ARE HERE. AC8 asks for the exit code of seven existing criteria plus
 * `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint`, each printed rather than assumed. Those are SUBPROCESSES,
 * and AC1 requires the criterion file itself to start none inside a fifteen-second budget — one
 * `npm run typecheck` alone is most of that budget. This file is the task's other executable artifact,
 * it already starts `git`, and it is not the file AC1's budget is about.
