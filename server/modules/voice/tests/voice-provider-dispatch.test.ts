/**
 * AC-139's criterion: the proxy path DISPATCHES — the wire the request is sent on is the selected
 * provider's adapter's, not this module's.
 *
 * WHAT IS BEING READ, AND WHY IT NEEDS A READING AT ALL. Registering a second recogniser was a
 * one-line change to the address book, and it would have gone on meaning nothing if
 * `voice.service.ts` kept composing the multipart request itself: the registry would have been a
 * description of behaviour the app never went through, and every consumer of the seam — the trim's
 * declaration, the health payload, the invariant board — would have been reading that description.
 * So the reading here is not "a second provider exists" but "the same service, handed the same
 * audio, sends what the SELECTED provider's wire says", which is only observable if the two
 * providers' shapes are driven through one entry point.
 *
 * The cases, and the criterion each belongs to:
 *
 *   AC2  the mutually exclusive pair — `dashscope-omni`'s chat-completions JSON and
 *        `openai-compatible`'s multipart form, driven by the same service on the same audio
 *   AC4  the proxy path's tolerance, on the five inputs the parity baseline was recorded with:
 *        the reading that must NOT move when the dispatch lands
 *   AC5  `AsrErrorCode` to HTTP, as a table with one row per member, each driven to the status it
 *        names, plus the one passthrough (an upstream status the adapter read is reported as
 *        itself)
 *   AC6  registration order and the health payload, which the new row must not have moved
 *   AC10 the scope statement, and the transport double that makes every reading above offline
 *
 * HOW THE READINGS ARE TAKEN. Every case drives the shipped `createVoiceService` and installs the
 * outbound port it takes as a dependency; nothing here re-implements a body or a parse. The one
 * exception is deliberate: AC4 compares against `scripts/__fixtures__/asr-extraction-parity-baseline
 * .json`, which was recorded before this task, so "the reading did not move" is decided by a file
 * this task cannot have written — not by a second copy of the expectation living in this file.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx --tsconfig server/tsconfig.json --test server/modules/voice/tests/voice-provider-dispatch.test.ts

/**
 * The new provider's module, imported DYNAMICALLY on purpose.
 *
 * The registry and the adapters that declare a capability form an import cycle: every adapter asks
 * the registry for `baseMimeType`/`declaredAcceptsMime` (a value import, so a real edge), and the
 * registry reads each adapter's `id`/`capabilities`/`wire`/`transcribe` while it builds its own
 * registration list. That cycle is fine when the REGISTRY is entered first — the adapters finish
 * evaluating before the list is built — and a `ReferenceError: Cannot access '<id>' before
 * initialization` when an adapter is entered first, because the registry then builds its list while
 * the module it is reading from is still in progress. Measured, in this order:
 *
 *   import ... from 'shared/asr/asrRegistry.js'                        -> the three ids print
 *   import ... from 'shared/asr/list/openai-compatible/...'            -> TDZ (pre-existing: that
 *                                                                         adapter's row is the first)
 *   import ... from 'shared/asr/list/dashscope-omni/...'               -> TDZ (this task's row)
 *
 * The cycle is not this file's to repair — breaking it means moving two pure functions out of the
 * registry, which is a change to the seam's shape and to a frozen adapter — so this file asks for
 * the adapter only after its static graph (the registry) has been evaluated. AC6 wants the
 * registry's row compared against the MODULE's own object, and this is that object.
