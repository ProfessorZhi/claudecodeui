/**
 * The relay's closing turn and its `session_send` shape — two deployment switches, resolved purely.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT A LINE IN THE COMPOSITION ROOT. Same reason as
 * `voice-realtime-mode.ts`: the switch has to be resolvable, printable and testable on its own, and
 * nothing here reads `process.env`, logs, or touches a socket. `server/index.ts` hands in the
 * environment at the ONE place the seams are assembled; a proxy handed no seam reads the shipped
 * default constants below, never the environment, so a criterion that sets nothing sees the same
 * default a deployment that sets nothing does.
 *
 * THE CLOSING TURN. After a delivered `session_send` the transport synthesizes a
 * `response.create` so the model can answer "OK" to nobody. Each such response re-reads the whole
 * context. On the 2026-10-15 23:00–00:02 journals 18 of 38 responses were exactly that, 46% of the
 * spend. Removing the RESPONSE alone had regressed twice the day it was tried (the next utterance's
 * response was spent on the reply the model had been told it owed), because the tool result and the
 * prompt still said "Reply with the single word OK". `silent` removes both REQUESTS instead —
 * the tool-result tail and the after-stop sentence — while the transport keeps sending the
 * protocol-mandatory resume: a `function_call_output` that is never followed by a `response.create`
 * leaves the turn unconsumed upstream, and eight such orphans filled the endpoint's turn queue
 * until the ninth user turn was refused (`Turn queue overflow: capacity=8`, 2026-10-18). Replays
 * through the shipped transport and bridge (`experiments/voice-realtime-closing-turn`: ten whole
 * sessions and windows, ¥0.40) kept every stop and lost no unit the closing turn delivered, at
 * 46–50% of its cost. `respond` is the previous wording, byte for byte — the rollback.
 *
 * THE SLIM SEND TOOL. The voice plane advertises `session_send` and `session_interrupt`. The first
 * carries the gateway's generic description and three fields (`session`, `waitSeconds`,
 * `correlationId`) the relay never reads on this plane. `on` advertises `message` alone with a one-line
 * description: −202 tokens on every response, same delivery in four replay windows.
 *
 * BOTH DEFAULT TO THE NEW BEHAVIOUR, AND AN UNKNOWN VALUE RESOLVES TO THAT DEFAULT — REPORTED. A
 * typo in a rollback (`VOICE_REALTIME_CLOSING_TURN=respnd`) must be said out loud rather than read as
 * a working rollback while the new behaviour stayed on; see `invalid`.
