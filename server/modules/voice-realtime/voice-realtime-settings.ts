/**
 * The voice relay's prompt, as a file the deployment can edit without a rebuild — and the ONE place
 * the C2 ContextPack is folded into it.
 *
 * WHY A FILE AT ALL. The relay prompt is the behaviour that gets tuned: P0a measured it, and the
 * next tuning SHOULD NOT need a code change plus a deploy to observe. So the prompt and the block
 * that introduces the pack live behind a path the deployment names
 * ({@link VOICE_REALTIME_SETTINGS_ENV}), and the shipped values are the defaults used when no file
 * is named.
 *
 * READ ONCE PER CONNECTION, AND THAT IS THE CONTRACT. `voice-realtime-ws-proxy.service.ts` calls
 * {@link loadVoiceRealtimeSettings} at the top of a connection and keeps the reading for that
 * connection's whole life. So an edit reaches the NEXT connection and leaves the live ones exactly
 * as they were — a session the user is speaking into must not have its instructions swapped under
 * it, because the Realtime model's behaviour is the thing being tuned and a mid-session swap makes
 * the change unattributable.
 *
 * THE KEY SET. Eight top-level keys are read, and NO OTHERS are — an unknown key is ignored, exactly
 * as it always has been, rather than refused:
 *
 *   · `version`         — a non-empty string, logged beside every injection so an edit is visible.
 *   · `instructions`    — the relay prompt, a non-empty string.
 *   · `contextTemplate` — the block that introduces the pack; must carry `{{context}}`.
 *   · `turnDetection`   — the upstream detector's parameters, as the WIRE spells them:
 *                         `{ "type": "server_vad" | "semantic_vad", "threshold": -1…1,
 *                            "silence_duration_ms": 200…6000 }`. Every sub-key is optional and the ones
 *                         left out fall through to the environment, then to the shipped 800 ms window —
 *                         see {@link resolveTurnDetection}, which owns that precedence. Values are
 *                         validated HERE, through the resolver's own validator, so a refused value is
 *                         reported in {@link VoiceRealtimeSettings.problems} and the connection falls
 *                         back to the default rather than shipping a half-applied detector.
 *   · `omissionFill`    — a PARTIAL override of the omission-fill producer's parameters, in the same
 *                         snake_case spelling the shipped `omission-fill-params.json` uses
 *                         (`{ "h_ms": 9000, "numeral_mode": "runs2", … }`). Absent keys keep the
 *                         compiled-in value. This is the hot-change path for parameters that
 *                         otherwise travel with the build; see {@link VoiceRealtimeSettings.omissionFill}.
 *                         A type error, an unknown `numeral_mode`, or an out-of-range H/G/score/weight
 *                         refuses the WHOLE file, so the connection keeps the shipped values and the
 *                         reason reaches `problems`.
 *   · `announcePhrases` — the announce closing turn's sentence table, as a `|`-separated string
 *                         (`"好的|收到|明白|在办"`). Parsed by
 *                         {@link resolveAnnouncePhrases}, which owns the minimum count, the
 *                         maximum length and the empty-segment rule. This is the settings-file
 *                         replacement for the compiled-in table; it deliberately has NO environment
 *                         variable, so the file is the only knob (the first key of the deployment-knob
 *                         migration away from env). A refused value leaves the shipped table in place
 *                         and puts the reason in `problems`, like every other shape error here.
 *   · `runEndAck`       — the run-end confirmation's candidate sentences, in the same
 *                         `|`-separated syntax (`"好的|收到"`), parsed by the SAME splitter the
 *                         `VOICE_REALTIME_RUN_END_ACK` environment variable uses. An empty table
 *                         means "the file said nothing", which lets the assembly point fall through
 *                         to the environment and then to no ack at all. This key and `summaryModel`
 *                         are the second batch of the env-to-file migration: the environment names
 *                         stay as escape hatches (environment > file > default), not as deletions.
 *   · `summaryModel`    — the side text model the run-end summary asks, a non-empty string (e.g.
 *                         `"qwen-flash"`). `null` means "the file said nothing", so the assembly
 *                         point falls through to `VOICE_REALTIME_SUMMARY_MODEL` and then to no real
 *                         producer (the stand-in arm). A blank or non-string value is a shape error
 *                         and puts the reason in `problems`.
 *
 * FAIL OPEN ON I/O, FAIL CLOSED ON SHAPE. A missing, unreadable or unparseable file falls back to
 * the shipped defaults with the reason in {@link VoiceRealtimeSettings.problems}; a file that
 * PARSES but violates the contract (an unknown `{{variable}}`, a block that never carries the pack)
 * is refused the same way. The difference matters: a malformed shape would otherwise ship a prompt
 * that silently drops the pack — the exact thing this task exists to deliver — while a missing file
 * is a deployment that simply wants the defaults.
 *
 * Consumers: `voice-realtime-ws-proxy.service.ts` (the loader and the composer) and this module's
 * tests. Nothing outside the module reads it, so it stays off the barrel.

/**
 * The session's `instructions` for one pack, and — when S-A has one — one execution-status line.
 *
 * An EMPTY pack leaves the prompt exactly as it was — no header, no blank lines, no "（空）" — so a
 * connection over a session with nothing said yet is byte-for-byte the pre-C2 behaviour. That is
 * also what keeps the no-context case measurable: a criterion can compare the composed string
 * against the base prompt and expect equality.
 *
 * `execStatus` is the S-A line (`[exec] phase=…`, SPEC §8.4) and is ABSENT until the execution
 * plane has something to say — a connection with no run started and nothing waiting composes to the
 * base prompt, which is what keeps the "no status, byte-identical" reading true. When it IS present,
 * the introduction and the staleness rule travel with it: the line is machine-shaped, and the model
 * must be told both what it is and that an old one is not the present.
 *
 * Consumers: `voice-realtime-ws-proxy.service.ts`'s `advertiseInstructions` (the one send path) and
 * this module's tests.
