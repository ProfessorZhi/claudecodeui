/**
 * The upstream turn detector's parameters — its type, its threshold and the silence window that closes
 * an utterance — resolved as a PURE FUNCTION of the environment, a per-run override and the deployment's
 * settings file.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT A LINE IN THE HANDLER. Before this switch existed, the relay shipped a
 * HARD-CODED `turn_detection` (`server_vad`, threshold 0.5, silence 400 ms) with no way to change it,
 * per deployment or per diagnosis. That literal is a BEHAVIOURAL CHOICE — how aggressively the upstream
 * VAD cuts a person mid-thought — and a behavioural choice that cannot be stated, printed or varied is
 * one nobody can measure. Resolution is a pure function of its three arguments: nothing here reads
 * `process.env`, nothing here opens a file, nothing here logs, and nothing here touches a socket. The
 * composition root
 * (`server/index.ts`, `buildVoiceRealtimeSeams`) calls {@link resolveTurnDetection} at the ONE place the
 * seams are assembled, and the HTTP diagnosis route hands the SAME resolver a per-run override — so a
 * deployment that sets nothing gets the shipped default, and a criterion that sets nothing reads the
 * SAME default rather than a copy of it.
 *
 * WHY THE SHIPPED WINDOW IS 800 AND NOT 400. The switch landed as a WIRE-NEUTRAL refactor: with nothing
 * configured the resolution reproduced the `{ type: 'server_vad', threshold: 0.5, silence_duration_ms:
 * 400 }` the transport carried, so the frames a browser saw were unchanged. The 400 was then MEASURED
 * and moved. `experiments/voice-realtime-fragment-hold-probe/RESULTS.md` (2026-10-15; three real
 * recordings × four repeats, `silence_duration_ms` the only variable) read HALF the upstream turns
 * (−38…−53%) and — the symptom this task exists for — a fifth to two thirds fewer RESPONSES (one per
 * half-sentence), while the relayed content held (relay characters / ASR characters 0.87–1.02) at
 * 0.1–0.5 s of extra end-of-turn latency and roughly half the spend on the two worst-split recordings.
 * So the shipped value is a DATA-DRIVEN choice, and the transport's own fallback IS this same object
 * (`DEFAULT_SESSION_DEFAULTS.turn_detection`), so the two cannot drift apart.
 *
 * WHERE THE VALUE MAY COME FROM. Three sources, in this order: the per-run override the diagnosis route
 * hands in (highest), the environment ({@link VOICE_REALTIME_TURN_DETECTION_SILENCE_MS_ENV} and its
 * siblings), then the deployment's settings file
 * (`VOICE_REALTIME_SETTINGS_PATH` → JSON `turnDetection`, validated by {@link validateTurnDetection}),
 * then {@link DEFAULT_TURN_DETECTION}. The environment deliberately OUTRANKS the file: it is the
 * deployment's escape hatch, and an operator rolling a value back must not have to edit a file another
 * process may own.
 *
 * WHY THE KNOB CANNOT TURN THE DETECTOR OFF. There is exactly ONE door to a session with no turn
 * detector: the segmented relay's `session.turn_detection: null`, which the bridge sends when the client
 * takes over the utterance boundaries. If this new knob could ALSO null the detector, a deployment
 * could disable it by a totally different route (a typo, a stray env var) and break the segmented path's
 * assumption that it is the only writer. So an "off"-shaped value is REFUSED and reported through
 * `invalid` (AC6) — never silently applied.
 *
 * WHY A MISCONFIGURATION IS REPORTED RATHER THAN OBEYED. The `invalid` field carries a readable
 * description of every value that was refused, and {@link describeTurnDetection} turns the resolution
 * into the ONE sentence the composition root logs. A silently-ignored
 * `VOICE_REALTIME_TURN_DETECTION=off` would look exactly like a working rollback while the detector was
 * still cutting utterances, so an unknown spelling resolves to the default AND is SAID OUT LOUD.

 *
 * HOW IT WAS VERIFIED (2026-10-19, from evidence already in this repo, no paid run):
 *
 *   · THE WIRE HAS NO INTERMEDIATE EVENT. The endpoint's observed server-VAD surface is exactly
 *     `input_audio_buffer.speech_started`, `.speech_stopped` and `.committed`
 *     (`voice-realtime-bridge.service.ts`, `TOLERATED_ENDPOINT_EVENTS`, enumerated from the preserved
 *     live capture `experiments/voice-realtime-ambiguity/real-trace/qwen38-omni-realtime-trace.json`).
 *     There is no "maybe" frame between speaking and silence.
 *   · `semantic_vad` DECIDES LATER; IT DOES NOT NARRATE THE DECISION. `docs/operations/
 *     voice-realtime-continuous-calibration.md` §C-1 (2026-10-12, qwen3.8-omni-flash-realtime) shows a
 *     real behavioural difference — 2 segments instead of 6 — but its timeline is
 *     `speech_started` at 11673 ms and `speech_stopped`/`committed` 2 ms later: one retrospective
 *     decision, not an in-flight uncertain state. The earlier P0-S4 probe had already found the
 *     control-plane acceptance of `semantic_vad` to be an echo
 *     (`docs/proposals/voice-realtime-segmented-relay-SPEC.md` §P0-S4, `echoDiscriminates=false`).
 *   · THEREFORE the "uncertain" state can only be INFERRED on the relay side from the length of a pause
 *     the relay itself measured (the uplink VAD's non-speech run) while the upstream turn is still open.
 *     That inference is what {@link decideBackchannel} encodes, and emitting it needs the relay's own
 *     proactive `response.create`.
 *
 * `false` IS A VERDICT, NOT A DEFAULT. If a future endpoint exposes a real uncertain-state event, flip
 * this only together with a measured reading; until then no caller may claim a semantic signal exists.
