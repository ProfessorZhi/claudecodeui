/**
 * The six tools the Realtime bridge advertises to a Realtime session, each a
 * field-for-field mirror of the MCP gateway's own declared tool schema.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `docs/proposals/voice-native-control-plane.md` §2 wants
 * the voice control plane to "speak the same language" the MCP gateway already
 * speaks: a function call the model emits for `session_send` has to carry the
 * SAME parameters an MCP client would send, or the two front doors drift into
 * two protocols. This module is that one language, written down once for the
 * bridge to advertise in `session.update`.
 *
 * WHY A MIRROR RATHER THAN AN IMPORT. The gateway's six Zod shapes are not all
 * reachable through its barrel (`ui_visible_context` / `session_get` / `run_get`
 * live inline in `mcp-gateway.read-tools.ts`'s body table; `approvals_list` is
 * module-private in `mcp-approvals.ts`), and importing the gateway's barrel at
 * runtime would drag express, the database and the voice/sensevoice boot into
 * this module — the Realtime bridge is meant to stay a lean, offline-provable
 * seam. So the shapes are mirrored here, and `tests/realtime-bridge-harness.ts`
 * supplies the gateway's OWN registrations as the oracle: `tests/
 * voice-realtime-bridge.test.ts` compares the two field by field every run, so
 * a drift on either side is a red, and the AC-2 false form proves that
 * comparison names the field it caught.
 *
 * Consumers: `voice-realtime-bridge.service.ts` (the descriptors are advertised
 * in `session.update`), and `tests/voice-realtime-bridge.test.ts` (the AC-2
 * comparison against the captured gateway registrations).

/**
 * The STOP tool: `session_interrupt`, the GATEWAY's contract plus the VOICE plane's audit pair.
 *
 * THE GATEWAY SIDE IS UNCHANGED. `mcp-gateway.write-tools.ts` still declares
 * `inputSchema: SESSION_INTERRUPT_INPUT_SCHEMA` (`{ session }`) and
 * `outputSchema: { aborted, message? }`, so an MCP client sees byte-for-byte what it saw before.
 * This descriptor is the VOICE plane's declaration, and the two fields it adds are read on the
 * voice side only: `voice-realtime-live-executor.ts` validates and then STRIPS them before the
 * gateway's own `readSessionInterruptInput` runs, and the proxy adds its three receipt readings
 * after the gateway's payload comes back.
 *
 *  - `intent` (OPTIONAL in the schema) — the model's own statement of what it took the user to
 *    want when it decided to stop. A stop is a JUDGEMENT, not a command, so the reading behind it
 *    belongs on the record: SPEC §6.2 makes it mandatory and §10.3 / C-3's "误停可审计" is
 *    unsatisfiable without it. It is nonetheless optional HERE, at the transport schema: the model
 *    omitting it is a real, observed form, and a required `intent` makes the transport reject the
 *    whole call (`TOOL_ARGUMENT_SCHEMA_VIOLATION`) — losing the stop AND the message it carried.
 *    An omitted intent is therefore accepted and the audit records `intent: null` together with
 *    `intentMissing: true`, never an empty string and never a fabricated reading — a record that
 *    said intent was given when it was not would be the lie.
 *  - `heard` (optional) — the transcription the judgement was made on. The model may legitimately
 *    have none (a stop with no words behind it), and an absent one is recorded as `null`, never
 *    invented.
 *  - `message` (optional) — the CORRECTED instruction, for an interrupt the model judged to be a
 *    change of direction rather than an outright stop (SPEC §0.3 D-6, §18.4 G1, GOAL-041 AC-342).
 *    The proxy enqueues it into the CLI's own queue and requires the enqueue's confirmation BEFORE
 *    it aborts, so the correction and the run it corrects ride the SAME turn (the E10/U2 reading);
 *    an absent one is exactly today's bare stop. It is a voice-plane field like the other two —
 *    stripped before the gateway — but it does not appear in the tool's description: the §6.3 tool
 *    budget has 9 bytes of slack and the instructions carry the directive instead.
 *
 * The `outputSchema` carries the three readings the voice plane's receipt adds to the gateway's own
 * payload (`runId`, `triggerSeq`, `queuedStillPending` — see `sessionInterrupt` in
 * `voice-realtime-ws-proxy.service.ts`); the gateway's `{ aborted, message? }` is what an MCP client
 * still receives.
 *
 * It is kept OUT of {@link REALTIME_TOOLS} on purpose. That array is the six-tool mirror the AC-2
 * comparison walks field by field against the gateway's captured registrations, and its LENGTH is
 * asserted in several places (`voice-realtime-dashscope-transport.test.ts`,
 * `voice-realtime-connection-resilience.test.ts`); a seventh entry there would red them all. The
 * stop tool needs no such mirror: it is a one-field command whose whole contract is "abort the
 * bound session", and the voice plane never advertises it with the gateway's required `session`
 * (see `VOICE_REALTIME_TOOLS`).
 *
 * THE DESCRIPTION IS PAID FOR ON EVERY TURN. `voice-realtime-status-tool.test.ts`'s AC6 pins the
 * three voice descriptions inside twice one `session_send` description (SPEC §6.3), so the hint that
 * the two new fields exist is squeezed into the sentence already there rather than added beside it.

 * bullet forbids a second, disagreeing computation — so a declared enum narrower than the reading
 * could carry would be the lie. `awaiting-permission` is §7.1's first-class phase but not yet

 * `session_send` is the relay's one job (see `VOICE_REALTIME_INSTRUCTIONS`): the model passes the
 * user's words on and does nothing else. `session_interrupt` is the exception the instructions name:
 * the person wants the running work stopped or taken a different way, and the model calls it to
 * abort the run in flight, carrying their words in `message`. There is no third tool — see below.
 * The five other mirror tools (`ui_visible_context`, `session_get`, `run_get`, `approvals_list`,
 * `session_background`) were never used to good effect — the model polled `run_get` with malformed
 * arguments and invented session ids for `session_get` — and cost about 600 tokens of EVERY
 * response's context: measured on the real endpoint, a session's fixed context was ~1,280 tokens,
 * and the bill is per token read per response.
 *
 * `session_status` WAS ADVERTISED AND IS WITHDRAWN (2026-10-14 ruling, journal `e650117b`; replay in
 * `experiments/voice-realtime-relay-mode-replay/`). It was the FULL reading behind the compact status
 * line (SPEC §6.3), offered so the model could ask for the detail. The ruling re-scoped the model to
 * a pen — it tidies the person's words and passes them on, and choosing when to ask the execution
 * plane for a fresh reading is not its job — so it is no longer advertised. The descriptor
 * ({@link REALTIME_SESSION_STATUS_TOOL}), the {@link VOICE_ONLY_TOOLS} whitelist, the live executor's
 * route and the proxy's reading all stay: withdrawing the advertisement is the whole change, and the
 * cleanup is a separate question. The remaining two descriptions stay inside the §6.3 tool budget
 * (they fit inside twice one `session_send` description).
 *
 * WHY NOT THE MIRROR AS-IS. The mirror must match the MCP gateway field by field (AC-2), and there
 * `session` is required because an MCP client names its target. A voice connection is bound to ONE
 * session by the connection itself, and the instructions tell the model never to name one.
 * Advertising `session` as required therefore made the real transport reject every call that obeyed
 * the instructions (`TOOL_ARGUMENT_SCHEMA_VIOLATION: session: expected string, received undefined`),
 * so the user's words were transcribed and then nothing ran. The executor already treats an omitted
 * `session` as the bound one and refuses a different one, so the fix is to stop advertising it as
 * mandatory, not to loosen the executor. `session_status`, while it WAS advertised, is not a gateway
