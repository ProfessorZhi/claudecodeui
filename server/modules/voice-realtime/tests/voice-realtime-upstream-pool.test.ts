/**
 * AC-321's criterion for the C3 upstream session pool — the active/standby pair and the
 * transparent idle rotation between them (SPEC `docs/proposals/voice-realtime-segmented-relay-SPEC.md` §C3).
 *
 * The pool is driven ENTIRELY over `realtime-bridge-harness.ts`'s fake transports — no
 * socket, no `fetch`, no real upstream — across the readings the AC names:
 *
 *  - AC1/AC2: the pool opens one active session and one pre-warmed standby, and after the
 *    idle threshold it rotates EXACTLY once, the switch costing no more than 1.5× the
 *    session-open latency P0a-S2 measured. That baseline is READ from
 *    `experiments/voice-realtime-segmented/p0/RESULT.json` at run time — never hardcoded —
 *    so a re-measured baseline moves the bound with it.
 *  - AC3: a segment in flight postpones the switch (nothing is stranded on the retired
 *    session), and a segment that arrives at the rotation instant is committed in the NEW
 *    session exactly once and delivered exactly once.
 *  - AC4: the standby receives no audio frames before the rotation, while still being
 *    warmed through `session.update` — the whole reason it exists.
 *  - AC5: both of those readings are shown to be load-bearing by two false forms, each a
 *    copy of the shipping module mutated BESIDE it and driven through the same scenario.
 *
 * Provenance (the goal record's AC-321): this file is the criterion. Run it with THIS
 * repo's runner — the tree is TS-ESM and `node --test` cannot remap `.js` → `.ts`:
 *
 *     npx tsx --tsconfig server/tsconfig.json --test server/modules/voice-realtime/tests/voice-realtime-upstream-pool.test.ts
 *
 * Consumers: the quay worker's AC state for AC-321.
