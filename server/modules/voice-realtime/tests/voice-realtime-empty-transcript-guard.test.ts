/**
 * The empty-transcript delivery guard.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS PINS (2026-10-11 02:38 CST, connection `d88c6722`). A segmented Live Voice call
 * committed four segments; one of them came back from the endpoint transcribed as the EMPTY string,
 * and the relay model answered that silence by inventing a user message from nothing:
 *
 *     18:38:23.955  segment seq=0 dur=19200ms reason=max frames=1
 *     18:38:30.777  << transcription.completed ""        ← the endpoint reported zero words
 *     18:38:31.050  << function_call session_send {"message": "（用户没有说话）"}
 *     18:38:33.552  session_send delivered in 1 ms        ← a message nobody said, in the session
 *
 * WHAT IS GUARDED, AND WHAT IS NOT. The only fact this guard acts on is MECHANICAL: the endpoint
 * reported zero words for a committed segment. It never decides whether a relayed message is a
 * faithful rendering of what the person said — the relay model legitimately repairs and rephrases,
 * and judging that is a model-capability question explicitly out of scope. So the boundary is
 * "empty vs not empty", and the negative control below (`嗯`/`呃`) is what keeps the predicate from
 * growing into a stop-word filter.
 *
 * WHERE THE GUARD SITS. At the DELIVERY point, not only where the transcription arrives: the
 * endpoint's transcript and the model's `session_send` call are independent upstream events and
 * either may land first (the defect happened to be transcription-first; the reverse is just as
 * legal). A call whose segment has no transcript yet is held briefly and released by whichever of
 * the two arrives first, so both orders reach the same decision.
 *
 * The first assertion in this file is AC1's — "an empty transcript delivers nothing" — deliberately:
 * a false form that made the empty segment deliver must red HERE, before any sibling assertion can
 * mask it.
