/**
 * The per-connection transport opt-in — GOAL-044 / AC-374 (decision doc §12.7).
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. Until this task the transport was a DEPLOYMENT switch: `VOICE_REALTIME_MODE`
 * was read once per process, so a browser could not take the continuous wire without a server change
 * affecting everyone. The opt-in adds the other axis — ONE browser asks, on ONE connection, for the
 * transport it wants, and that choice overrides the deployment for that connection alone.
 *
 * FOUR FACTS, and each is checked where it actually runs:
 *
 *   · PARSING — `parseVoiceRealtimeTransport` reads the connection URL's value, and every value that
 *     is not a known transport reads as "asked for nothing" so a typo can only fall back, never blank
 *     the relay.
 *   · OVERRIDING — a choice WINS over the resolved environment for the connection it was made on.
 *   · THE HANDSHAKE — a connection wired with `transport: 'continuous'` is answered with silence and
 *     the log NAMES the reason (this connection asked), told apart from the deployment's own switch.
 *   · turn_detection — the continuous wire's `session.update` ALWAYS carries an explicit, valid
 *     `turn_detection`. This is the invariant the opt-in rests on: with the browser no longer cutting
 *     utterances, the endpoint's own VAD is the only thing that can, so it may never be omitted and
 *     may never be `null`. The last block proves the assertion is not vacuous by running it against
 *     the two shapes it must reject (omitted and `null`).
 *
 * Run with this repo's TS-ESM test runner:
 *
 *     npx tsx --tsconfig server/tsconfig.json --test \
 *       server/modules/voice-realtime/tests/voice-realtime-transport-opt-in.test.ts
