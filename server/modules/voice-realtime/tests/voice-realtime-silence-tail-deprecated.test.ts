/**
 * Silence Tail Suppression, RETIRED FROM PRODUCTION — the disconnect, read where it actually binds.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. The 2026-10-14 ruling 「STS 已证实无效，取消生产调用」 takes
 * `createSilenceTailGate` off the production path: `server/index.ts`'s assembly point
 * (`buildVoiceRealtimeSeams`) NEVER hands a `silenceTail` seam to the proxy — on any path, for any
 * `VOICE_REALTIME_SILENCE_TAIL` value — so the continuous wire forwards every captured frame exactly
 * as it did before STS existed. The MODULE, its tests and its probe docs are KEPT: they still prove
 * the state machine was behaviourally correct in isolation; only the production call site is gone.
 *
 * FOUR READINGS, each against the fact it pins:
 *
 *   · AC1 — THE SEAM KEY IS GONE FROM THE ASSEMBLY POINT. `buildVoiceRealtimeSeams` is a local,
 *     unexported const in `server/index.ts`, so the composition root is read as SOURCE TEXT (the
 *     repository's established form for this file — see `voice-realtime-transport-opt-in.test.ts`).
 *     The region is sliced from `const buildVoiceRealtimeSeams` to `function resolveIdleRotateMs`,
 *     its locatability is asserted first (so a failed slice is a red, never a vacuous green), and the
 *     `silenceTail:` property KEY must not occur inside it.
 *   · AC2 — THE OLD SWITCH IS REPORTED AS DEPRECATED/IGNORED, AND ONLY WHEN IT IS ON. The deprecation
 *     line sits behind the `silenceTail.enabled` guard in the same region; an unset switch resolves to
 *     `enabled:false` (asserted here against the real resolver), so nothing is logged — silence means
 *     "unconfigured", exactly as before.
 *   · AC3 — THE SWITCH IS BYTE-FOR-BYTE INERT ON THE WIRE. The REAL proxy is driven, over the SAME
 *     fake-transport harness the suppression criterion uses, with a PRODUCTION-SHAPED seam (no
 *     `silenceTail`), once with the switch on and once with it unset: the frames handed to
 *     `bridge.sendAudioFrame` are identical, and equal the browser's own frames. The control — the
 *     SAME harness with the seam actually filled (the pre-disconnect wiring) — DIVERGES, so the
 *     identity reading is one that could have gone the other way.
 *   · AC4 — THE PROXY'S STS-OVER-UPLINK-VAD EXCLUSION BRANCH CANNOT RUN IN PRODUCTION. The STS seam is
 *     never filled (AC1), so the proxied `silenceTail` is null on every production path. A LATER ruling
 *     (「上行 VAD 生产显式启用入口」) added an ENV-GATED uplink-VAD arm point to the same assembly point
 *     (`gap-live-voice-uplink-vad-production-arm-point`), so the seam is buildable now — but it is OFF
 *     unless the environment names a backend, and even a deployment that names one cannot reach the
 *     branch: the branch's other conjunct (`silenceTail !== null`) is false on every production path.
 *     This task does NOT remove that branch — it is read as still present.
 *
 * Run with this repo's TS-ESM test runner:
 *
 *     npx tsx --tsconfig server/tsconfig.json --test \
 *       server/modules/voice-realtime/tests/voice-realtime-silence-tail-deprecated.test.ts
 *
 * Consumers: the quay worker's AC state for `gap-live-voice-sts-production-disconnect`.
