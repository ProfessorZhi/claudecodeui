/**
 * The ONE merged pending message — Live Voice queues as a single bubble (ruling 2026-10-14).
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE PINS. Until this ruling a sentence spoken while Claude was busy became a command in
 * the CLI's own queue the moment the relay model passed it on, and the CLI merged those commands only
 * at the turn boundary — so the page drew one row per sentence and the person watched a stack of them
 * (the 2026-10-14 morning reading: two registries disagreeing and a row that would not go away). Under
 * this ruling the merge happens one layer EARLIER, in the relay: while the bound session reports a run
 * in flight, every relayed piece joins the SAME buffer, nothing reaches the CLI, and the whole thing
 * goes in as ONE message when the run ends. The browser is told what the buffer says through a
 * `pending` frame and draws ONE read-only card for it.
 *
 * WHAT IS DRIVEN. `handleVoiceRealtimeConnection` — the real proxy — over the fake browser socket and
 * fake transport the other continuous-mode criteria use, with the SCRIPTED CLI HOST behind the
 * executor so a delivery is a real command in a real queue. The only hand-built seam is
 * `hostRunActivity`, whose `busy` field is the host's one answer to "is a turn in flight"; a test
 * flips it to end the run.
 *
 *   · AC1(a) — busy: three relayed pieces are held (0 deliveries), the last `pending` frame carries
 *     all three in speaking order, and the moment the run ends they arrive as EXACTLY ONE message.
 *   · AC1(b) — busy with words held, a `session_interrupt` carrying a correction enqueues EXACTLY ONE
 *     message before the abort, and that message carries, in order: the interrupt note, the held
 *     words, the correction. The delivery AFTER the stop must NOT repeat the note.
 *   · AC1(c) — the hold is bounded: a piece that would overrun {@link VOICE_QUEUE_MAX_BYTES} is
 *     refused (`refused` frame), and the buffer is left exactly as it was.
 *   · AC1(d) — the connection closing with words held delivers them once, not zero and not twice.
 *   · AC1(e) — an IDLE sentence keeps the old behaviour: one delivery after the coalescing window,
 *     and no `pending` frame at all (the hold is a busy-session thing).
 *   · AC7 — a final transcription (the caption path) arriving while words are held must NOT reopen
 *     the 1 s coalescing window under the hold; the only release stays the run ending (the second
 *     route to the 2026-10-14 evening mid-turn release, reached without the phase leaving `busy`).
 *
 * Run:
 *   npx tsx --tsconfig server/tsconfig.json --test \
 *     server/modules/voice-realtime/tests/voice-realtime-single-pending-message.test.ts

 * zero deliveries, a `pending` card the whole time — until the rounds reading flips to `false`, at
 * which point the WHOLE merged message goes in ONCE. Before the composition existed (a `busy` read
