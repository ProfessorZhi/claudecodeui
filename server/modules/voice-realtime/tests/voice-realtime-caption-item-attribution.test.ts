/**
 * Which SEGMENT a transcription belongs to — decided by the endpoint's item id, not by whichever
 * segment happened to be open when the words landed.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS PINS. The endpoint transcribes asynchronously, and the journal of 2026-10-12
 * (`~/.cloudcli/voice-realtime-log/ef9daacd-*.jsonl`) shows its answers arriving well after the commit
 * that produced them, and one segment never transcribed at all. The relay used to attribute every
 * transcript to `activeSegmentSeq`, the segment that happened to be open when the words arrived. For a
 * NON-empty transcript that is merely a wrong label; for an EMPTY one it refuses the wrong segment's
 * genuine relay — the variant V reading in `e2e/voice-realtime-segmented-replay-20261012.spec.ts`,
 * where a late empty transcript for segment C marked the ACTIVE segment empty and threw away the words
 * the person had actually spoken.
 *
 * WHAT REPLACES IT. The endpoint's `input_audio_buffer.committed` accepts a commit and names the item
 * it created; `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed` names the same item. The item id
 * is therefore the one key that survives the reordering. The bridge owns both sides — it writes the
 * commit and reads the answer — so it pairs them (`pendingCommitSeqs` → `onUserAudioCommitted`) and
 * this service resolves a transcript's segment from the item (`segmentSeqByItemId` →
 * `segmentSeqForCaption`). An item created by the endpoint's OWN detector belongs to no commit of
 * ours; it resolves to `null`, and `null` is reported as `null` rather than defaulted to the active
 * segment.
 *
 * ONE PROPERTY OF THE WIRE EVERY FIXTURE HERE RESPECTS: the endpoint answers commits IN THE ORDER THEY
 * WERE SENT, so the Nth `input_audio_buffer.committed` pairs with the Nth outstanding commit. A
 * fixture that delivered one acceptance for two outstanding commits would be scripting a wire that
 * cannot happen, and it would pair the item with the wrong seq for a reason of the fixture's own.
 *
 * THE FIRST GROUP IS THE FALSE FORM (AC1): the shipping service is copied beside itself with
 * `segmentSeqForCaption` put back to `return activeSegmentSeq;`, and the same scenario is run through
 * both, so the reading every later group depends on is shown to go RED rather than being green for a
 * reason of its own. The last group replays the journal's own frame order and reads the per-segment
 * attribution table out of it (the task's DoD).
 *
 * Consumers: the quay worker's AC state for
 * `gap-live-voice-caption-segment-attribution-by-item-id`.

 * WHY NOT THROUGH THE PROXY. The slot that must be released on a refusal is the bridge's own
 * `pendingCommitSeqs`, and the proxy holds a STATIC import of the shipping bridge — a mutated copy
 * written beside it is never the one the proxy talks to. Driving the mutant through the proxy
 * therefore reads the shipping bridge and reports it as a false form: measured, and it read green on
 * both sides until this was moved here. The pairing the proxy reads is exactly what these two hooks
 * carry, so the unit surface is the same fact one seam closer.
