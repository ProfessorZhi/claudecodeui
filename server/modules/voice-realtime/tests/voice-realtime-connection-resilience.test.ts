/**
 * AC-311's criterion: the Realtime connection's reconnect and response-concurrency
 * resilience, regressed against the race the live run ACTUALLY hit.
 *
 * The evidence is not invented here. `experiments/voice-realtime-ambiguity/
 * real-trace/qwen38-omni-realtime-trace.json` is a real capture of the adopted
 * target model (`qwen3.8-omni-flash-realtime`) in which the endpoint's server-side
 * VAD started a response at the same moment the client resumed the turn after a
 * tool result, and the endpoint answered:
 *
 *     {"type":"error","error":{"type":"invalid_request_error",
 *      "message":"Conversation already has an active response"}}
 *
 * Every frame this file feeds is extracted from that trace BY PREDICATE (never by
 * index, so a re-captured trace cannot silently shift what is being replayed), and
 * the extraction asserts each frame was found and that the error frame lands AFTER
 * the response it complains about — which is exactly why absorption cannot be
 * gated on "a response is in flight".
 *
 * The six readings:
 *
 *  - AC1: the transport exposes a NAMED in-flight-response state
 *    (`responseConcurrency`) and consults it — a resume synthesized for a tool
 *    result is HELD while the endpoint has a response in flight and flushed, once,
 *    when that response completes.
 *  - AC2: replaying the recorded race through the new code path leaves the
 *    connection open and the error frame ABSORBED (reported as the attributable
 *    `RESPONSE_CONCURRENCY_CONFLICT`, never surfaced as an unexplained event and
 *    never an uncaught throw).
 *  - AC3: the same replay against a copy with the state tracking removed must
 *    redden on that error frame — the endpoint reproduces it.
 *  - AC4: a simulated drop + reconnect resumes the SAME logical session: the tool
 *    result the endpoint never acknowledged is replayed once, an acknowledged one
 *    is not re-sent, no executor runs twice, and the session is re-advertised on
 *    the new socket.
 *  - AC5: `npm run typecheck` / `npm run lint` are the static gate — no test here.
 *
 * The D-section below is the FAULT-INJECTION leg of the Live Voice double-drop gap (journal
 * `e22ac831`), on the same real proxy, bridge and transport: the scripted endpoint is driven by the
 * journal`s own dial-by-dial plan, and D1–D6 read six properties that sequence has to keep. All six
 * are asserted DIRECTLY against the code this branch ships
 * (`gap-live-voice-reconnect-epoch-scoped-commit-pairing`: epoch-scoped commit pairing, a reconnect
 * budget spent per connection, and a `segment_ack` that is graded by what the endpoint answered) —
 * the five legs that were wrapped against that fix were retired when it landed. A reading that could
 * be satisfied about nothing carries a FALSE FORM beside it: the same assertion, over a fixture that
 * is broken on purpose, has to redden on its OWN message.
 *
 * The AC3 mutant is a copy of the shipping transport written BESIDE it (its
 * relative imports resolve there), named with `__criterion-falsify-` so
 * `server/tsconfig.json` excludes it from the typecheck program — the same
 * convention the voice criteria's false forms use — and removed in a `finally`. A
 * closing case proves this process left none of its own copies behind.
 *
 * Provenance (goal record AC-311): this file is the one file the criterion names.
 * The server tree is TS-ESM — source imports use `.js` specifiers that resolve to
 * same-named `.ts` files — and Node's type-stripping does NOT remap `.js` → `.ts`,
 * so it MUST be run with THIS repo's runner:
 *
 *     npx tsx --tsconfig server/tsconfig.json --test <this file>
 *
 * Consumers: the quay worker's AC state for AC-311.

// ── D1–D6: the 2026-10-12 double drop, replayed offline ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// WHAT THIS SECTION IS. The 2026-10-12 journal (`e22ac831`) is a real session's whole lifecycle, and
// it is the sequence every reading below is written against:
//
//     seq0  delivered.                          seq1  the endpoint reported NO WORDS for it
//     seq2  commit, then CONNECTION_LOST with the commit in flight; the reconnect REPLAYED it and
//           the second dial lost every event it was told, then dropped 1.15 s later; the replay is
//           suppressed (a segment is replayed once), so seq2 was never transcribed at all.
//     seq3  delivered.                          seq4  empty, but reported as "segment 2 dropped".
//     seq5  delivered.                          seq6  the third loss exhausted the reconnect
//                                                     budget, and the connection closed for good.
//     seq7–12  `segment_ack committed` for every one of them, with NOTHING on the wire.
//
// Six readings are taken from ONE scenario built out of that sequence — the REAL bridge, the REAL
// transport and the REAL ws proxy, with the scripted stand-in's fault plan (`F1`–`F6`) as the
// endpoint and an in-process EventEmitter as the browser. D1, D2, D4, D5 and D6 were written as
// known-defect legs against `gap-live-voice-reconnect-epoch-scoped-commit-pairing` (they were FALSE
// against the code that shipped before it, and said so with `expectKnownDefect`); that task landed,
// the wrapper was retired, and each leg is now asserted directly. D3 held all along.
//
// WHAT REPLACED THE WRAPPER. A wrapper's other direction was "this statement is still false": once
// the fix is in, the live question is whether the reading can fail AT ALL — an "all"/"none" over a
// collection is satisfied when the collection is empty, and an assertion that cannot fail is not
// evidence. So each of D2, D4, D5 and D6 carries a FALSE FORM beside it: the same assertion, run
// against a fixture that is broken on purpose, which has to redden on the assertion's own message.

/**

 *
 * `onSend` runs BEFORE the frame is recorded, which is what makes D6's reading possible: the number

 * The two things a REAL socket does that the in-process stand-in does not, modelled in one place: it
 * delivers an inbound frame a turn LATER, and it is DEAD once it has closed.
 *
 * WHY THE DELAY. `createScriptedUpstream` answers a client frame SYNCHRONOUSLY inside `send`, so the
 * endpoint`s event is dispatched while the writer is still inside its own `transport.send(...)` call.
 * A real socket answers a round trip later. That difference is load-bearing for every reading below:
 * `writeSegmentClose` writes the commit and only THEN pushes the segment`s `seq` onto
 * `pendingCommitSeqs`, so under a synchronous answer the endpoint`s own
 * `input_audio_buffer.committed` is paired BEFORE the `seq` is on the queue — `shift()` finds
 * nothing, every item id pairs with `null`, no item id can be attributed to a `seq`, and the
 * cross-epoch mis-attribution these scenarios exist to pin is unobservable. One microtask of
 * delivery latency restores the order a socket has.
 *
 * WHY THE DEAD WRITE. The stand-in answers whatever is written to it, whenever it is written —
 * including the frames a dying dial was still closing, which a real socket discards and the endpoint
 * behind it never sees. No reading below waits on those answers, so this half is fidelity rather than
 * load-bearing: it is here because the alternative is an endpoint answering a request that no live
 * connection ever carried, and a scenario that later DOES read one of those answers would be reading
 * a fiction.
 *
 * Neither model changes what the scenario ARMS; both are properties of the transport`s socket, which
 * is why they live here rather than in the stand-in every other criterion reads.
