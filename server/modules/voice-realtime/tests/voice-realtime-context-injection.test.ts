/**
 * The C2 ContextPack, on the SERVER half of the wire: what the proxy does with the
 * `context` frame the browser sends, and where the resulting text goes.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. AC-320's client suite (`voiceContextPack.test.ts`) proves
 * the pack is BUILT from the transcript's visibility rules. Nothing until this file
 * proved it is INJECTED — that the proxy turns one frame into the upstream session's
 * `instructions`, that a session with nothing said is left byte-identical to what it
 * was before C2, and that the prompt is a per-connection reading so an edit lands on
 * the NEXT connection instead of under a live one (`voice-realtime-settings.ts`).
 * Fully offline: the same `createFakeTransport` the bridge suites use stands in for
 * the DashScope upstream, and a minimal EventEmitter stands in for the browser's
 * WebSocket, exactly as `voice-realtime-ws-proxy.protocol-simulation.test.ts` does.
 *
 * WHAT EACH CASE PROVES:
 *   - the pack reaches the session: one `context` frame becomes an upstream
 *     `session.update` whose `instructions` carry the pack under the shipped header;
 *   - no pack, no change: a connection that is never sent a `context` frame opens
 *     with instructions BYTE-IDENTICAL to `seams.instructions` (the empty case has
 *     no header and no blank lines — which is also what makes it comparable);
 *   - the cap is enforced here: a frame over `VOICE_REALTIME_CONTEXT_MAX_CHARS` is
 *     refused whole with a log line, and the next, in-budget frame is still injected
 *     (so the refusal is about the size, not a broken path);
 *   - read-once: one settings file read is held for a connection's whole life —
 *     editing the file under a live connection does not change what that connection
 *     composes, while the next connection reads the new file;
 *   - fail open on I/O, fail closed on shape: an unreadable file falls back to the
 *     shipped defaults with the reason logged, and a frame that is not JSON is
 *     ignored rather than forwarded.
 *
 * Run with this repo's TS-ESM test runner (source imports use `.js` specifiers that
 * resolve to same-named `.ts` files):
 *
 *     npx tsx --tsconfig server/tsconfig.json --test \
 *       server/modules/voice-realtime/tests/voice-realtime-context-injection.test.ts
