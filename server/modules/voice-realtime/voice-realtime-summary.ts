/**
 * The run-end summary's SIDE TEXT MODEL leaf: one short, spoken sentence about what a finished run
 * did, produced by the realtime model's HTTP twin instead of by the relay.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The narrator layer already owns WHEN a summary is spoken (the run-end
 * transition, see `voice-realtime-narrator.ts`) and the proxy already owns the quality gate (no
 * Markdown, no verbatim tail; length is a READING, not a refusal — see the 2026-10-20 measurement
 * below). What was missing is WHERE the words come from: the first wiring answered with a fixed
 * stand-in sentence. B-1 (see `experiments/voice-realtime-announce-summary/summarize.mts`) showed
 * that an omni flash model — the HTTP twin of the realtime relay model — turns a real Claude Code
 * output into a compliant spoken summary under the `voice` prompt variant. This leaf is that
 * probe's production shape: one `chat/completions` request per run end, no streaming, no audio.
 *
 * WHY `qwen-flash` (2026-10-20). The omni twin took 5.9 s on a single ask and 7.4 s / 12.3 s in the
 * two production turns; `qwen-flash` answered the same request in 0.58–0.69 s. Its answers run
 * 42–44 chars, which the old ≤40-character gate refused — so the gate was dropped (the prompt now
 * asks for terseness rather than counting) and the model was swapped. The context pack is NOT
 * trimmed: 1400 → 600 chars saved ~80 ms and the pack also serves the relay's coreference.
 *
 * A LEAF, NOT AN ASSEMBLY. Nothing here reads the environment, opens a socket at import time, or
 * knows which credential the deployment uses: the composition root (`server/index.ts`) decides
 * whether this leaf is active and hands it the user's DashScope key. The `fetch` option is the test
 * seam, exactly as the local TTS leaf's `loadDependency` is.
 *
 * FAILURE IS A NULL, NOT A THROW. An empty key, a non-2xx answer, an unreadable body, an empty
 * summary or a network error all resolve to `null`; the narrator then speaks nothing for that run.
 * A thrown error here would surface as an unhandled rejection in the proxy's run-end watcher, where
 * "there is nothing to say" is the correct and unremarkable answer.
