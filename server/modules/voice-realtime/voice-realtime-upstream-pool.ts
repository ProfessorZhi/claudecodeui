/**
 * The upstream SESSION POOL — one active Realtime session plus at most one pre-warmed
 * standby, and a transparent idle rotation between them (SPEC §C3).
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. Measured on the real upstream (P0a / S2): opening a Realtime session and
 * getting to `session.updated` costs `p50=259ms p90=736ms min=130ms max=736ms`, and the
 * socket is NOT warmed before the response is done (`warmed_before_done=false`). A relay
 * that opens its session only when the user starts speaking therefore spends that latency
 * on the first thing they say. The fix P0a concluded workable is what this module ships:
 * keep a session open, keep a SECOND one opening next to it, and when the active one has
 * been idle long enough, switch to the standby and refill in the background.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. A `RealtimeBridge`. Every method the proxy calls is forwarded to whichever
 * session is active at that instant, so the proxy, the executor and the page cannot tell a
 * pool from a single session. A rotation swaps the session UNDER those calls — it never
 * migrates history: the context is re-injected into the new session by the context pack
 * (SPEC §C2), which is why a rotation is only ever attempted while nothing is in flight.
 *
 * TWO RULES THE SPEC IS EXPLICIT ABOUT, and where they live:
 *  1. NO ROTATION WHILE SOMETHING IS IN FLIGHT — a segment's audio, or a commit whose
 *     response is still owed, keeps the current session. Switching there would strand the
 *     half-delivered utterance on a session that is about to be closed. See
 *     {@link canSwitchNow}.
 *  2. THE STANDBY GETS NO AUDIO — it opens a connection and is told the session
 *     instructions (so it is warmed through `session.updated`, the P0a measurement), and
 *     that is all. Audio frames go to the active session only; the criterion counts the
 *     standby's `input_audio_buffer.append` frames and requires 0 before a rotation.
 *
 * WHAT A ROTATION COSTS, AND WHAT IT SAYS. The switch is synchronous once the standby is
 * known ready: from the trigger to the flip the pool only awaits the standby's `open`
 * (usually already true, so a microtask), and the retired session is closed OFF the hot
 * path. `rotate` is logged with the facts the SPEC asks for —
 * `rotate from=<n> to=<n> idleMs=<n> standbyAgeMs=<n>` — plus `switchMs`, the measured
 * trigger→flip latency the criterion bounds against the P0a baseline.
