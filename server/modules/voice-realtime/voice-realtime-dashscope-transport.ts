/**
 * The real DashScope WebSocket transport for the Realtime bridge.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `voice-realtime-bridge.service.ts` is deliberately
 * transport-injected: it speaks a WebSocket-shaped interface but never opens a
 * socket itself, so the bridge's behaviour is provable offline. This file is the
 * ONE place that turns that interface into a real socket: it dials DashScope's
 * Qwen realtime endpoint, translates the bridge's client messages into
 * DashScope's OpenAPI dialect (the "widely used realtime event form"), and
 * translates the server's events back into the bridge's vocabulary. The bridge
 * is reused byte-for-byte — its `connect()` is called with this transport as the
 * injected seam.
 *
 * WHY THE TRANSLATION IS NOT PASS-THROUGH. The two sides disagree on three
 * shapes, and each disagreement is a place a naive adapter would silently drop
 * traffic:
 *
 *  - `session.update`: the bridge hands over a flat tool declaration
 *    (`{ type, name, description, parameters }`); DashScope wants the OpenAI
 *    nesting (`{ type: 'function', function: { name, description, parameters } }`).
 *  - `function_call_output`: the bridge emits one message; DashScope needs the
 *    result wrapped as a `conversation.item.create` with a `function_call_output`
 *    item, THEN a `response.create` to resume the turn.
 *  - server → client: DashScope announces a tool call through
 *    `response.function_call_arguments.done` (and, in some dialects,
 *    `response.output_item.done` carrying a `function_call` item); the bridge's
 *    routing key is a message of `type: 'function_call'` with `callId`/`name`/
 *    `arguments`. Both deliveries are normalised here, de-duplicated by
 *    `call_id`, because a duplicate would make the bridge send the tool output
 *    twice.
 *
 * WHY INBOUND CALLS ARE VALIDATED HERE. The model is an untrusted peer: it can
 * name a tool that was never advertised, or hand a declared tool arguments that
 * violate the schema the session advertised. The bridge already refuses a name
 * with no executor, but nothing checks the ARGUMENTS against the declaration, so
 * a schema-violating call would otherwise reach the executor unchecked. The
 * transport is the only seam that sees BOTH the `session.update` it forwarded
 * (name → declared parameter shape) and the inbound call, so it records the
 * advertised tools and rejects a call that names an unadvertised tool
 * (`UNDECLARED_TOOL`) or violates a declared parameter shape
 * (`TOOL_ARGUMENT_SCHEMA_VIOLATION`) — both reported through `onError`, never
 * routed to the executor. The check goes live only once a `session.update` has
 * been forwarded: a session that advertised nothing has no whitelist to enforce,
 * so the transport does not invent one. Non-object / non-JSON arguments are left
 * to the bridge (`MALFORMED_FUNCTION_CALL`), which owns that report.
 *
 * WHY THE TRANSPORT OWNS THE RESPONSE-CONCURRENCY STATE. The endpoint runs
 * server-side VAD, so IT can start a response (`response.created`) at the same
 * moment the client decides to resume the turn after a tool result. A second
 * `response.create` then is rejected with `error: "Conversation already has an
 * active response"` — the exact frame `experiments/voice-realtime-ambiguity/
 * real-trace/qwen38-omni-realtime-trace.json` recorded live (exchange index 44:
 * the client sent its own `response.create` one millisecond before the server's
 * first response completed). The transport synthesizes that `response.create`
 * for every `function_call_output`, so it is the layer that must not let it
 * race: it keeps a NAMED in-flight-response state ({@link
 * DashscopeResponseConcurrency}, read off `response.created` / `response.done`),
 * holds the synthesized `response.create` back while one is in flight, and
 * flushes it — coalesced — when that response completes. A conflict frame the
 * endpoint reports anyway is attributed here as the `RESPONSE_CONCURRENCY_CONFLICT`
 * transport error and ABSORBED, never forwarded: the transport is the only layer
 * holding the state that makes the frame attributable, so it is the layer that
 * answers for it. (That is the one deliberate exception to "the transport never
 * decides for the bridge that an event is unimportant", and it exists because
 * the alternative — the bridge reporting a known, survivable race as an
 * unexplained event — is strictly less honest.)
 *
 * WHY A RECONNECT REPLAYS UNACKED OUTPUTS. A `function_call_output` is not done
 * when it leaves the socket: the endpoint acknowledges it with a
 * `conversation.item.created` item carrying the same `call_id` (the trace's index
 * 43). A drop between "sent" and "acknowledged" would silently lose the tool
 * result and stall the turn, so the transport keeps the unacknowledged outputs
 * keyed by `call_id` and replays them, once each, when a socket comes back up.
 * The `call_id` key IS the de-duplication: an output the endpoint already
 * acknowledged was removed, so a reconnect can never re-send it and make the
 * model process the same result twice. (A `response.create` still held by the
 * gate when the socket dies is dropped with it: the unacknowledged result's
 * replay re-synthesizes one, and the endpoint's own VAD resumes the turn.)
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITATION (AC-308 AC11, recorded so it is NOT mistaken for a bug).
 * `tool_choice: required` (and DashScope's equivalent setting) does NOT guarantee
 * the model calls a tool on every turn — the model may answer in text instead.
 * This is a property of the endpoint, not a defect to "fix" here, and it must NOT
 * be worked around by feeding this harness only inputs that always trigger a
 * call: the live trace's `functionCalls[]` is whatever the model actually chose,
 * and `capture-live.ts` exits non-zero rather than retry-until-it-calls.
 *
 * WHY THE MODEL IS AN OPTION. `DEFAULT_DASHSCOPE_REALTIME_MODEL` is the model
 * GOAL-030 formally adopts (`qwen3.8-omni-flash-realtime`): live, it honours
 * `session.tools`, emits a real endpoint-assigned `function_call`, accepts the
 * `function_call_output` backfill and continues the same turn. Its `session.update`
 * requires an explicit `voice: "Tina"` (see the `voice` option below). The earlier
 * alias `qwen3-omni-flash-realtime` connects and transcribes real audio but does
 * NOT accept `session.tools` — it answers a tool-shaped request in plain text
 * instead of emitting a function call — so it is kept only as historical evidence
 * (`experiments/voice-realtime-ambiguity/real-trace/named-model-connect.json`),
 * never as the default. The model stays a config option so a caller can pick any
 * sibling without a code change.
 *
 * WHY THE SOCKET IS INJECTED. `socketFactory` is the seam the criteria use: the
 * shipping default dials with `ws`, while `tests/` injects an in-process fake WS
 * server so the whole round trip — connect, `session.update`, audio frames,
 * function call, `function_call_output` — runs with zero real network. The same
 * seam makes the live trace reproducible and lets the AC-4 false form replay a
 * recorded trace against the fixture.
 *
 * Consumers: the module barrel (`index.ts`), the voice-realtime criteria
 * (`tests/voice-realtime-dashscope-transport*.test.ts`), and the manual live
 * capture (`experiments/voice-realtime-ambiguity/real-trace/capture-live.mjs`).
