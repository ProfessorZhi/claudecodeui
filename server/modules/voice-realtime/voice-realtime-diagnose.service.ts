/**
 * HTTP-layer Live Voice diagnosis: push an audio file through the SAME
 * `/voice-realtime` proxy a browser microphone uses, and report what happened.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Live Voice failed in production while every offline test was green,
 * and the only way to look was a human with a microphone. Three layers hid it: the
 * proxy suite used a fake transport, the e2e stand-in answered with a hand-written
 * call, and the server logged nothing about what the upstream said. This service is
 * the direct, scriptable path: it drives `handleVoiceRealtimeConnection` itself (not a
 * re-implementation of it), with an in-process stand-in for the browser socket, the
 * real upstream transport, and the real executor — so a result here is a result for the
 * microphone path too. The three mechanisms are therefore: the live microphone, the
 * UI's hidden upload seam (browser, e2e) and this (HTTP, no browser at all).
 *
 * It answers the two questions a "no reasoning output" report needs separated:
 *   - `heard`:    did the upstream transcribe the audio (a final caption arrived)?
 *   - `answered`: did the model act on it (a `session_send` went out)?
 * and, when not, lists why (`problems`) from the frames and the wire timeline.
 *
 * Consumers: `voice-realtime.routes.ts` (the HTTP route) and `server/index.ts` (which
 * also reuses {@link summarizeWireObservation} for the always-on upstream log).
