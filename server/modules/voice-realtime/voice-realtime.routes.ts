/**
 * The module's two HTTP routes.
 *
 * `POST /api/voice-realtime/diagnose` — the HTTP-layer way to exercise Live Voice.
 *
 * Takes an audio file instead of a microphone, runs it through the same proxy a
 * browser connection uses (see `voice-realtime-diagnose.service.ts`), and returns what
 * the upstream heard and what the model did. The route only parses and validates
 * transport input and formats the response; the work is the service's.
 *
 * `DELETE /api/voice-realtime/log` — clears the live relay's on-disk journal (see
 * `voice-realtime-log.ts`) and answers how many connection records were removed. The
 * store is injected, so the route itself knows only the shape of the answer.
 *
 * Body (JSON):
 *   sessionId   string   required — the session the run is bound to
 *   audioBase64 string   required — a mono 16 kHz PCM16 WAV, or raw PCM16 with format "pcm16"
 *   format      "wav" | "pcm16"   default "wav"
 *   dryRun      boolean  default true — when true `session_send` is recorded, not delivered,
 *                         so a diagnosis never injects a message into a real conversation
 *   speed       number   default 1 (real time), 0.25–8
 *   turns       array    optional multi-turn script: [{ audioBase64, gapMs? }, …] (max 8, WAV only),
 *                         spoken in order on ONE connection; replaces audioBase64
 *   quietMs     number   default 5000 — end once the upstream has been quiet this long
 *   maxMs       number   default 90000, ceiling 180000
 *   turnDetection object optional — per-run override of the upstream turn detector,
 *                         { type?, silenceMs?, threshold? }; VALUES are validated by the same
 *                         resolver the environment is, so an out-of-range number falls back to the
 *                         deployment's default and is reported, never applied
 *
 * Consumers: `server/index.ts`, which mounts it behind `authenticateToken`.
