/**
 * Registers the run and hands the turn to the provider runtime.
 *
 * `extraRuntimeOptions` is how an edited message asks the provider to resume
 * partway instead of continuing from the tip; a normal send passes nothing.
 *
 * Exported for this module's transport-agnostic control service
 * (`chat-control.service.ts`): its `send` calls this with `ws = null` and a
 * `beforeRun` hook, so a run opened by MCP or a timer is registered and
 * dispatched through the exact same path `chat.send` uses rather than a second
 * copy of the registry logic.
 *
 * `beforeRun`'s second argument states whether this dispatch took the
 * resident-session busy path — the registry refused the first `startRun`,
 * `acceptsBusyInput` answered yes, and the turn was admitted as a superseding
 * run. It is reported here, through the same hook that reports the run, because
 * the fact belongs to this function's own control flow: a caller that wants to
 * know "was this turn queued into a running process" must not re-derive it by
 * probing the registry, and existing callers (a plain `chat.send`, an edit)
 * simply ignore the extra argument.
 *
 * `connectionOverride` separates "who this run streams to" from "who a refusal
 * is written to". The transport-agnostic control service dispatches with
 * `ws = null` (it reports refusals as its own result, so `dispatchRun` must not
 * also write a `RUN_IN_PROGRESS` frame) but still binds the requesting socket as
 * the run's connection, so a `chat.send` driven through the control service
 * reaches the same audience as before. Left `undefined` by callers that only
 * ever have one socket, in which case `ws` is used.
 *
 * `source` is the run's recorded origin, when the caller knows one the
 * connection cannot state. The control service passes it explicitly because it
 * always dispatches with `ws = null` (and, for a WebSocket send, with a
 * connection override that is also null): without it, `startRun`'s
 * connection-derived default would file every run the service opens as
 * `scheduled`, including a `chat.send` that arrived over a socket and an MCP
 * tool call. Left `undefined` by callers that want `startRun`'s existing
 * default (a run with a connection is `user`, one without is `scheduled`).

 *     whose matrix says `backgroundTasks: false` is `unsupported` here, before

 *  5. the requested `toolUseId` must equal the Turn Tracker's pending foreground
 *     tool (`readSessionForegroundToolUseId`) — anything else is
 *     `no-foreground-match`, with the driver un-called and no state moved;
 *  6. only then is the runtime asked, and the capability matrix decides whether
 *     the provider can carry it at all.
 *
 * The receipt never carries or writes a task state. `requested` means the request
 * was accepted and placed; whether the task then appears is the reducer's, driven
 * by the frames the CLI emits — this handler writes nothing and the tracker is
