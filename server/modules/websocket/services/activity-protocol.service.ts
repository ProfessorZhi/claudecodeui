/**
 * The authoritative activity snapshot for one session: what the server knows the
 * session is doing, stamped with who is saying it and when.
 *
 * This is the record the whole activity protocol moves. A client never assembles
 * it by patching deltas — the server hands the *whole* thing on every change (see
 * `recordChange`) and hands the same whole thing over REST to a client that joins
 * late, so the two paths cannot disagree about what the session's activity is. The
 * fields are:
 *
 *  - `sessionId` — the app session id the client subscribes with. It is carried in
 *    the body (not only in the URL) so a frame and a snapshot are the same shape
 *    whether they arrive over the socket or over HTTP.
 *  - `bootId` — the identity of the running process, the same value the heartbeat
 *    frames carry, so a client can tell "the server restarted" from "the session
 *    is busy". It is *the same* value by construction: this module reads the one
 *    `BOOT_ID` the heartbeat owns rather than generating a second one.
 *  - `rev` — the session's monotonic activity revision. It is the single number
 *    that lets a client tell a continuous stream from one with a hole in it, and it
 *    has exactly one producer in the process (see `readActivityRevision`).
 *  - `asOf` — the instant the snapshot was produced, read from the injected
 *    `now()`. The protocol has no local clock of its own: every timestamp here is
 *    whatever the injected reader answered, so a criterion can pin it and a
 *    caller cannot be surprised by a value that came from `Date.now()` anyway.
 *  - `turn` — the session's turn phase, from the providers module's reduction,
 *    joined with the identity of the turn's run when the driver knows one
 *    ({@link ActivitySnapshotTurn}). Transported, not computed here.
 *  - `tasks` / `schedules` — the session's live task and schedule projections. Their
 *    internal shape belongs to the reducers that own them (AC-191 / AC-192); this
 *    module only carries whatever the injected readers answer, which is why the
 *    element type is `unknown` rather than a shape redefined here.
 *  - `deliveries` — the session's accepted deliveries, in send order: what is
 *    still queued or running, plus every one that ended inside the retention
 *    window (SPEC §7.1). This is the one projection whose *element* shape this
 *    file names, because it is the channel's own contract rather than a reducer's
 *    private record: a client draws a pending row and settles it from exactly
 *    these ten facts, and a reader that had to discover the shape from the
 *    producer would be reading a copy of it.
 *
 *    Optional in the *type*, and only there. Every snapshot this module builds
 *    carries it — `buildSnapshot` reads it from the reader unconditionally — but a
 *    frame-shaped literal written by a caller (a criterion injecting a
 *    hand-built frame to prove a client ignores an unplaceable one) is still a
 *    well-formed frame without it, and requiring the field would have made this
 *    channel's arrival edit criteria whose subject is not this channel. A reader
 *    that needs the queue reads `snapshot.deliveries ?? []`.
