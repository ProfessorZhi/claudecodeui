/**
 * Criterion — the service worker this server ships must not answer a transient fetch failure with a
 * response of its own. `public/sw.js` is served from `publicDir` by this module, and it used to
 * resolve a failed navigation with a worker-authored HTML page and every other failed request with
 * `Response.error()`. One transient origin outage (the server restarting and cutting an in-flight
 * request) then read to the user as "the app says it cannot be reached" and only a manual refresh
 * recovered it, because the page's own retry never saw the real failure.
 *
 * The worker is a classic script with no imports, so it is loaded verbatim into a `node:vm` context
 * whose `self` and `caches` are fakes and whose `fetch` is chosen per reading. Each reading fires
 * the captured `fetch` listener with a real FetchEvent shape and settles the promise handed to
 * `respondWith`:
 *
 *   (1) a failed NAVIGATION fetch settles REJECTED — the real network error passes through;
 *   (2) the discriminating control: a worker that keeps the fallback resolves with the
 *       worker-authored HTML, so (1)'s reading cannot pass because the harness rejects everything;
 *   (3) a failed NON-navigation fetch with no cache entry settles REJECTED, not `Response.error()`;
 *   (4) a failed NON-navigation fetch WITH a cache entry still serves that entry — the network-first
 *       fallback was narrowed, not removed.
