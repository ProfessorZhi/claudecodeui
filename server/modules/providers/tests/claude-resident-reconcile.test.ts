/**
 * Criterion for the resident host's reconcile loop and its §10.2 log lines
 * (AC-390, SPEC §10.1, §10.2, §12 S5).
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. The ledger (S1) made a resident session's state
 * derivable, and the run registry holds the runs. Neither reads the other, and
 * the 2026-10-14 defect (`fdd3e920`) sat exactly in the gap: a run the registry
 * still held as `running` for a session whose ledger had stopped moving, with no
 * later frame able to close either. §10.1's answer is a reconcile check over the
 * two readings, and this criterion is that check's reading.
 *
 * THREE LINE FAMILIES, ONE READING EACH (§10.2), all of them with `session=`:
 *
 *   · `[reconcile] … mode=<log|enforce> anomaly=<code>` — the anomaly, written
 *     wherever the ledger records one (four codes reach it that way) or by the
 *     reconcile check itself (`phantom-run`).
 *   · `[ledger] … delivery=<8> state=<s> turn=<8|-> source=<…>` — one per
 *     DELIVERY whose state moved.
 *   · `[turn] … turn=<id> kind=<…> open|close …` — one per turn that opened and
 *     one per turn that closed.
 *
 * HOW IT IS DRIVEN. A REAL `ClaudeResidentHostDriver` over a REAL session-host
 * manager and a scripted process (the injected `createProcess` seam), with the
 * three things a reconcile reading needs injected: the clock, the run registry
 * PORT (`connectedClientCount` is the precedent — the registry lives in the
 * websocket module, which imports this one, so the edge cannot be an import),
 * and the log sink. No real `claude` binary is started and no service is
 * restarted.
 *
 * THE FALSE FORM (AC (f)), and why leg (c) is the leg that carries it:
 *
 *   Remove ONE condition from the reconcile check — the "a turn is open, so
 *   nothing here is phantom" guard — leaving "the registry says a run is going
 *   and the ledger has stood still past `T_q`". Leg (c) then closes a REAL turn
 *   that is in flight: `longTurnClosed=true` where it must read `false`, and its
 *   `turn` lease disappears. That is over-settlement, the thing §10.1 forbids
 *   ("不用 lease 定时过期来「修」：那会结算真正在跑的 turn"). No other leg reds
 *   under that mutant — (a) and (b) inject a divergence with NO turn open, and
 *   (d)/(e) inject no registry run at all — so the red names the defect rather
 *   than a neighbour. Every reading is collected and printed before anything is
 *   asserted, so a red lands on the wrong reading and not on a timeout.
 *
 * Red lines:
 * - The process budget guard below kills the whole process with `exit 3` rather
 *   than failing one case, as in the sibling resident criteria.
 * - `T_q` and `T_int` are injected (200 ms / 50 ms), so no leg pays the shipped
 *   ten seconds of wall clock; every reading taken across a deadline is the line
 *   it produced, never the wait.
 * - Nothing here reads a private field: the readings come from the driver's own
 *   `reconcileTick` / `ledgerReading`, from the manager's lease projection, from
 *   the injected registry port, and from the lines the driver handed the sink.
 *
 * Run with this repo's TS-ESM test entrypoint:
 *
 *     npx tsx --tsconfig server/tsconfig.json --test \
 *       server/modules/providers/tests/claude-resident-reconcile.test.ts
