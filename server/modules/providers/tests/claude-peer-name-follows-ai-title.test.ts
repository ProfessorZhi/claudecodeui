/**
 * AC-171 criterion — the peer name a Claude session answers to follows the
 * session's own Claude Code title, on both launch paths.
 *
 * The sibling criterion `claude-resident-addressable.test.ts` settled *whose*
 * name a process carries: Claude Code's own, derived per process, with the app
 * injecting nothing. That left the other half of the gap open. A derived name is
 * the CLI's fallback — the cwd's directory name plus two random characters — so
 * the address `ListAgents` publishes is machine-shaped while the same session's
 * Claude Code title is a readable phrase the user already sees. This task
 * supplies the readable half: both launch paths hand the session's *own* title
 * to the CLI in the SDK handshake, and the CLI registers it under
 * `nameSource: "auto"` — the rung it reserves for a title it adopted rather
 * than one a user typed.
 *
 * What is measured, on real processes (the real `claude` binary against an
 * Anthropic-compatible mock endpoint):
 *
 * 1. A brand-new session's first round hands the CLI *no* title, and the
 *    transcript says so: title generation ran and an `ai-title` row was
 *    written. This is the constraint the design turns on — a title passed at
 *    session creation *suppresses* generation outright, so a build that handed
 *    one over here would leave every new session with nothing to adopt.
 * 2. From the second round on, the title handed over is
 *    `getSessionInfo(providerSessionId, { dir }).summary` — the session's own
 *    title, never the display name the app has cached — and the process
 *    registers `nameSource: "auto"` under exactly that string, byte for byte.
 * 3. The safety rope: the `custom-title` a launch persists is byte-equal to the
 *    `ai-title` the session already had. The value handed over *is* that title,
 *    so a diverging `custom-title` can only mean the app handed over something
 *    else.
 * 4. The name does not move on later turns. It is stable because of where the
 *    app reads it, not because the CLI ignores a handed title — a round handed
 *    a *different* string renames the process, which is what makes this reading
 *    falsifiable. What freezes is the app's input: once the adopted title is
 *    persisted as `custom-title` it outranks the `ai-title` below it, so
 *    `getSessionInfo().summary` keeps returning the adopted value and every
 *    later round hands over the same string.
 *
 * Both launch paths are covered and each reading prints the one it took
 * (`path=per-run|resident`): the per-run runtime, which starts a process per
 * turn, and the resident driver's cold start.
 *
 * Two control arms, both run against a real process launched through the same
 * option builder the product uses, with one variable changed. They are what
 * keep the readings above falsifiable inside one unmutated run:
 * - The *suppression* control hands a title to a brand-new session, so leg 1's
 *   missing `ai-title` means "generation was suppressed" and not "this endpoint
 *   cannot produce a title at all".
 * - The *app-name* control hands over the display name the app has cached, so
 *   leg 2's agreement means "the name follows the title handed over" and not
 *   "the registry always says `auto`" — and it is leg 3's rope failing on the
 *   arm it is supposed to fail on.
 *
 * Red lines:
 * - The process budget guard below kills the whole process with `exit 3` rather
 *   than failing one case, so a lifecycle that hangs is a budget kill with its
 *   own reading, as in the sibling criteria.
 * - Every reading is printed before anything is asserted.
 * - The registry readings are taken while the process is still holding its turn
 *   open. A per-run process lingers for `BG_WAIT_CEILING_MS` after its `result`,
 *   and that hold is the only thing that makes a per-run process readable at
 *   all: nothing else in the app reports a per-run pid.
