 * that module for the id and the gate seam), so a self-registration would close
 * a cycle and read a half-evaluated binding.
 *
 * The gate decides whether anything exists. While it is closed the factory
 * returns null and the key is never written, so `resolveProvider('debug')` fails
 * exactly as a typo does — and nothing at all was constructed, rather than a
 * provider with a plausible-looking fixture home that a later bug could reach.
 *
 * What is injected is the point of the shape: the product's own normalizer
 * (`sessions`), its own frame forwarder, and an indexer pointed at the fixture
 * home instead of the user's real transcripts.
 *
 * `declareRuntimeCapabilities` is injected here because the capability matrix is
 * this module's, and because the debug agent is not in `LLMProvider`: the
 * declaration records `resident` mode and a multiplexed host against the runtime
 * id, so the union-keyed table stays a complete description of the union. No
 * `openRun` seam is injected — the run registry belongs to the websocket module,
 * which imports this one, so the edge back would close a cycle; the provider
 * states that gap rather than papering over it when an unattended turn needs it.
