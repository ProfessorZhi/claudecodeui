/**
 * Whether `name` is one of the addresses this app assigned to a session.
 *
 * History: the resident host driver used to build a launch address as
 * `slug(title) + '-' + appSessionId.slice(0, 6)` and hand it to the CLI as
 * `--name`. The app no longer names anything — the CLI derives the name of the
 * process itself and the app only reads it — but the shape is still on disk in
 * every transcript an older build wrote, and the CLI wrote it back twice: as
 * the session's `agent-name` *and* as its `custom-title`. The title it slugged
 * was the session's own display name, so a relaunch folded the previous address
 * into the next one and a transcript can hold the same `-<id6>` two, three or
 * four times over.
 *
 * Two readings, strongest first:
 *
 * - With the app session id in hand (the steady state — the row exists and the
 *   transcript is already linked to it) the test is exact: the name ends in the
 *   id of the very row it is stored on. An `agent-name` a real agent picked
 *   cannot end in that id, so it is never mistaken for one of ours.
 * - Without it (a transcript that has not been linked to an app row yet) the
 *   fallback is the minted shape: a trailing `-` and exactly six lowercase hex
 *   characters. App session ids are UUIDs, so every address this app ever minted
 *   has that shape, and the cost of the fallback being wrong is bounded — a
 *   genuine `agent-name` that happens to end that way ranks below an `ai-title`
 *   instead of above it, which is the same side of the line the guard wants.
 *
 * Consumers: the Claude session synchronizer uses it to keep such a reading off
 * the top rung of the title ladder, and the session-name migration uses it to
 * reclassify rows an older build polluted. Both import it through
 * `@/modules/database/index.js`.
