/**
 * The falsification controls for scripts/asr-second-adapter-check.mjs (AC-132).
 *
 * Each case below first runs the probe against an UNMUTATED fixture and requires green, then
 * applies exactly one mutation and requires red. Both halves matter: only the second proves the
 * probe notices the fake form, and only the first proves the red came from the mutation rather
 * than from a probe that is red for every input.
 *
 * The fixture is built at run time, in a temporary directory, OUT OF THE SHIPPING FILES — copied,
 * never re-typed. A hand-written stub would only prove the probe reads the stub; a copy of the
 * real modules is what makes these cases evidence about this repository's adapter rather than
 * about a paragraph describing it.
 *
 * The mutations are the fake forms the criteria name, one apiece:
 *
 *   · AC1 — the guard is removed, so the over-budget audio is handed to the transport anyway. The
 *     "zero requests" half is the thing that has to notice, and it is a counter, not an inference.
 *   · AC2 — the budget is measured on the audio's own bytes, which is exactly the reading the
 *     request-level name exists to forbid: the same audio passes alone and then passes again with
 *     a long context beside it.
 *   · AC3 — the honors declaration stops being applied, so a hint the provider does not
 *     acknowledge is put on the wire.
 *   · AC4 — the response parse goes lenient, returning the whole body as the transcript.
 *   · AC5 — the declaration claims it can fall back to a files API, a policy the first version
 *     does not allow.
 *   · AC6 — the registry hands back a declaration that is not the one the module exports.
 *   · AC7 — the adapter reaches for the ambient fetch instead of the injected one.
 *   · AC8 — the adapter is not resolvable out of the registry, and separately produces no readable
 *     outcome at all. Neither is allowed to read as green.
 *
 * Run with: node --test scripts/asr-second-adapter-check.test.mjs
