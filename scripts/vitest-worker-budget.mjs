// scripts/vitest-worker-budget.mjs — derive vitest's client worker width from the REAL scope budget.
//
// Why this exists (gap-vitest-worker-cap-from-real-scope-budget):
//
// vitest.config.ts used to size the client pool from `os.availableParallelism()` alone —
// `min(CLIENT_MAX_WORKERS, floor(availableParallelism() / 2))` — i.e. from CORES ONLY. That is half
// a budget: it ignores memory entirely. A pool of N workers, each allowed a 4352 MB V8 heap
// (`poolOptions.forks.execArgv --max-old-space-size`), means the config's *theoretical* heap ceiling
// is N × 4352 MB — 8 × 4352 = 34.8 GiB at the current width — while the scope the suite actually
// runs in is capped well below that (measured `.quay/suite-cgroup-evidence.txt`: memoryMax=16G).
// Nothing stopped a scope-limited run from asking for a pool whose ceiling exceeded its own cap.
//
// ⛔ 4352 MB is a CEILING, NOT A RESERVATION. V8 is *allowed* to grow each worker's old space to that
// limit; it does not pre-allocate it. 34.8 GiB is therefore a theoretical upper bound and MUST NOT be
// treated as a measured peak. The only measured number is the cgroup's own `memory.peak` for a real
// run (recorded per round in the task's Evidence). Measured in a 16 GiB scope: the client suite
// peaks ≈ 4 GiB at 8 workers — an order of magnitude under the theoretical 34.8 GiB. Sizing the
// width from the theoretical ceiling would starve the pool to satisfy a number nothing ever hits;
// sizing it from the budget below keeps the pool honest about what the scope can hold.
//
// The budget is the INTERSECTION (minimum) of three quantities:
//   · effective CPU cores  — cgroup `cpu.max` / cpuset / nproc, via scripts/effective-capacity.sh
//     (that probe walks the ANCESTOR chain too, so a quota that lives on the slice above is found);
//   · the ancestor constraints the probe already folds into `effective_cpu`;
//   · the CALLER'S OWN scope `memory.max` — scripts/effective-capacity.sh's `scope_mem_max_mb`, which
//     reads the own cgroup's limit (not the outer session cap). ⛔ A 16 GiB suite scope nested inside
//     an 8 GiB session cap must budget from 16384, never from the outer 8192.
//
// ⛔ THE FLOOR IS BOUNDED BY THE BUDGET (invariant). A "floor" of some minimum width must never let
// the derived width exceed what the budget allows: if the budget works out below that floor, the
// width goes below it too. There is deliberately NO floor of 4 anywhere below — the returned width is
// `min(budget, …)`, and the only lower bound is 1 (vitest cannot run with 0 workers).
//
// PER_WORKER_BUDGET_MB is the per-worker memory reservation the memory side of the budget divides by.
// It is a MEASURED-derived policy number, not the heap ceiling: the suite's maximum single-file heap
// reading is 1401 MB (`--logHeapUsage`, recorded in vitest.config.ts), and 2048 MB is the tightest
// power-of-two at or above 1.3 × 1401 MB. It stays FAR below the 4352 MB heap ceiling on purpose —
// the ceiling bounds one worker's worst case, the budget bounds the POOL's total.
//
// Overridable, but never escapable: QUAY_VITEST_MAX_WORKERS raises or lowers the width WITHIN the
// budget only. An override above the budget is clamped back into it (`min(override, budget)`), so the
// escape hatch cannot re-open the oversubscription this module exists to close.
//
// A .mjs, not a .ts, on purpose: scripts/tsconfig.json type-checks `scripts/**/*.mjs` (checkJs,
// strict) and is .mjs-only by design, so a .mjs here is the ONLY shape that both runs under bare
// `node` and lands under the same strict type gate as the rest of scripts/.
