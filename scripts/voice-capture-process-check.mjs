/**
 * voice-capture-process-check.mjs — the criterion for AC-148.
 *
 * WHAT THIS JUDGES. Not an assembly built inside this process, but a REAL service process:
 * `server:dev`'s own command, started with an explicit environment, read from its own stdout and
 * answered through ONE real HTTP request. Every reading below is either a line that child process
 * printed or a fact the upstream double observed on its own socket. Nothing is inferred from an
 * in-process construction — which is exactly the falsifying form AC-148 exists to exclude: "the
 * capture port records when a test injects it" says nothing about the shipped assembly.
 *
 * THE LOOP, TWICE. The same flow runs for `VOICE_CAPTURE=text` and for `VOICE_CAPTURE` absent:
 *
 *   1. an upstream double on `127.0.0.1:<port>` answers `POST /audio/transcriptions` with one fixed
 *      JSON body and RECORDS every request it was actually sent;
 *   2. the real service starts with the run's own `HOME` / `DATABASE_PATH` / `SERVER_PORT` / `HOST`
 *      and `FORCE_COLOR=0`, so its lines are compared as text rather than as escape sequences;
 *   3. a one-time Bearer token is minted against THAT run's database (`scripts/mint-token.mjs`);
 *   4. ONE real multipart `POST /api/voice/transcribe` (field name `audio`) is sent and answered.
 *
 * WHY BOTH RUNS ARE READ TOGETHER. "Zero capture lines" is worth nothing on its own — a request
 * that never arrived also produces zero lines. So the two runs share one criterion: BOTH must get
 * HTTP 200 carrying the double's text verbatim, and only the `text` run may have a capture row. An
 * implementation that ignores `VOICE_CAPTURE` therefore reds on the first run rather than passing
 * as a deployment that happened to record nothing.
 *
 * WHY THE UPSTREAM IS A DOUBLE. Reaching the real DashScope would need a credential from `.env`,
 * make the criterion non-hermetic, and turn a red into "the network was down". The price is stated
 * rather than hidden: the double speaks only the openai-compatible multipart wire, so "the shipped
 * recogniser's own protocol still holds" is NOT proven here — see the note block at the end.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It imports no shipped source (the `service-source-imports`
 * reading is computed from this file's own text), it drives no browser, and it reads the child's
 * stdout rather than `server.log` — redirecting a process's output is the deployer's business, and
 * the property under test is what the process writes to standard output.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   node scripts/voice-capture-process-check.mjs [--root <dir>] [--keep]
 *
 *   --root <dir>  the checkout whose `server/index.ts` is judged (default: this script's own repo)
 *   --keep        keep the run directory (debugging — the run directory only; the hardened copy is
 *                 always removed). Its path is printed either way.
 *
 * THE OBJECT JUDGED IS A HARDENED COPY OF `--root`, NOT `--root` ITSELF. Running the child straight
 * out of `--root` made this criterion's verdict depend on the deployer's own `.env`: `server/load-env.ts`
 * fills every key the child's environment does not already carry, so a `.env` naming `VOICE_CAPTURE`
 * made "the variable is unset" unimplementable and the criterion bailed out with `EMPTY_READING` — a
 * verdict about the instrument's preconditions wearing the shape of a verdict about the implementation.
 * So the object judged is a one-time hard-link copy made BESIDE `--root` (same filesystem by
 * construction), with `.git` and `.env` left out; the child's world is then one this criterion defines.
 * `--root` itself is only ever READ. `env-file-in-root` / `env-file-pins-voice-capture` record what it
 * carried, `judged-root` / `judged-root-env-file` / `hardened-root-removed` record the copy, and the
 * copy is removed on EVERY exit.
 *
 * EXIT CODES. 0 = every reading is the expected one. 1 = at least one is not, and each failing one
 * is named on stdout. 2 = the measurement could not be made at all (no tsx under `--root`, a hardened
 * copy that could not be built, a server that never came up) — a distinct outcome on purpose, because
 * "could not measure" must not read as "measured, and the property failed". A `.env` pinning
 * `VOICE_CAPTURE` is a READING (`env-file-pins-voice-capture=true`), never an exit.
 *
 * The real-database reading is ATTRIBUTED, not inferred from timing: it is false only when this
 * process's own tree was observed (via `/proc`) holding the inherited database, so a run that ends
 * in "could not measure" but carries that evidence is still exit 1 — the property failed whatever
 * else the run did.
