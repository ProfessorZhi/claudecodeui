/**
 * The falsification controls for scripts/asr-dashscope-omni-check.mjs (AC-138).
 *
 * Each case first runs the probe against an UNMUTATED fixture and requires green, then applies
 * exactly one mutation and requires red naming the token the fake form should trip. Both halves
 * matter: the second is what proves the probe notices the fake form, and the first is what proves
 * the red came from the mutation rather than from a probe that is red on every input. A criterion
 * that is red whatever the tree says would pass every "must be red" claim in the task while
 * measuring nothing, which is the failure mode this file exists to close.
 *
 * THE FIXTURE IS BUILT AT RUN TIME, IN A TEMPORARY DIRECTORY, OUT OF THE SHIPPING FILES — copied,
 * never re-typed. A hand-written stub would only prove the probe reads the stub; a copy of the real
 * modules is what makes these cases evidence about this repository's adapter rather than about a
 * paragraph describing it. The probe reaches the fixture through `--root`, which is the only way it
 * can be pointed at a tree other than its own.
 *
 * THE TOKENS ARE THE PROBE'S OWN, and the cases below assert them rather than merely the exit code:
 * a probe that went red for an unrelated reason would otherwise count as evidence for every claim
 * here at once. Where a fake form could trip more than one reading — a system turn that lost a
 * segment is both a missing segment and a wrong composition — the case asserts the reading that
 * NAMES the thing the fake form changed.
 *
 * Run with: node --test scripts/asr-dashscope-omni-check.test.mjs

 * module as ESM, and without it the fixture's own imports are resolved as CommonJS and the probe
 * cannot load the adapter at all (`asr-second-adapter-check.test.mjs` measured this as
 * `ERR_REQUIRE_CYCLE_MODULE`). `tsconfig.json` comes along for the same reason: the fixture is meant
 * to be loaded the way the repository is loaded, not under a hand-written approximation of it.
 *
 * The board is in the list because the probe feeds it the shipping adapter, and the registry because
 * the probe reads the contract face out of it. Neither is registered or dispatched through — the

 * the shipping one, copied rather than trimmed.
