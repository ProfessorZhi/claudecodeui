/**
 * A fake microphone that plays a REAL corpus WAV into the Live Voice capture chain.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (E0 / voice-output-e2e-harness). The repository already has two ways to put
 * audio in front of the product:
 *
 *   · `e2e/voiceRealtimeFakeMic.ts` — a synthetic timeline (sine/noise) pushed on the same
 *     worklet message port the real capture uses. It is the deterministic harness every
 *     continuous-wire criterion is written against, but it can only play an envelope it
 *     generates; it cannot replay a frozen recording.
 *   · Chromium's `--use-file-for-fake-audio-capture` — a real device stand-in, used by the
 *     dictation/ASR specs. It is a real `getUserMedia` capture path, but it needs the audio file
 *     at browser launch and cannot be driven frame-by-frame from the spec.
 *
 * This module is the missing middle: it accepts the PCM samples of a real recording and pushes
 * them through the SAME fake Web Audio graph the continuous-wire harness installs — 100 ms frames
 * on a real timer, into the app's own worklet port. Everything downstream (the client's encoder,
 * the `/voice-realtime` socket, the proxy, the relay) is the shipped code, so a pass here is a
 * reading of the product's capture-to-socket path, not of a fixture's private convention.
 *
 * IT IS DELIBERATELY A SIBLING OF `e2e/voiceRealtimeFakeMic.ts`, NOT A REWRITE OF IT. The two
 * differ in one input: that one synthesises the timeline, this one is handed samples. The graph
 * shape — `AudioContext`, `AudioWorkletNode`, `navigator.mediaDevices` — is kept identical
 * because it is what the app's `acquireMicrophone()` drives; changing it here would make this
 * harness measure a capture graph the rest of the suite never exercises.
 *
 * THE FRAME LEDGER IS LOAD-BEARING. `atSample` advances by one frame's worth of samples per push,
 * exactly as the real worklet does. A player that pushed samples without moving the ledger would
 * trip the client's own `LiveSegmenter.push` ("chunk arrived after …") on its first frame.
